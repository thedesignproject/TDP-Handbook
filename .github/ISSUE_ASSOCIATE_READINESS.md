## Problem Statement

The current SOP defines a 3-phase progression for customer presentations (Observer → Co-Presenter → Lead Presenter), with Phase 3 (Month 6+) stating that the "Lead attends as advisor only." However, we lack clear criteria for when an Associate is ready to lead calls **completely independently** without the Lead's compulsory presence.

This creates ambiguity around:
- When can a Lead safely skip a customer call?
- What specific behaviors indicate an Associate has reached full autonomy?
- How do we distinguish between "Lead Presenter with advisor present" vs. "Independent Leader"?

## Proposed Solution

Add a new section to the SOP (likely in **Growth Framework** or **Customer Delivery** process) that defines behavioral indicators showing an Associate is ready for full call ownership without mandatory Lead presence.

## Readiness Indicators

### Communication & Relationship Ownership

**Symptoms that show the Associate owns the customer relationship:**

- ✅ **Naturally initiates small talk** — Opens calls with rapport-building conversation without prompting
- ✅ **Proactively goes over next steps** — Closes calls by outlining action items and timelines without waiting for Lead's cue or approval
- ✅ **Overlapping communication with Lead** — Both Associate and Lead function as customer representatives; customer receives consistent messaging from either party
- ✅ **Customer directly addresses Associate first** — Customer naturally treats Associate as primary contact, asking questions/sharing feedback directly to them
- ✅ **Maintains async communication independently** — Sends Slack updates, Loom recordings, and written responses with appropriate tone and strategy without requiring Lead review

### Strategic Thinking & Problem-Solving

**Symptoms that show the Associate thinks beyond execution:**

- ✅ **Confidently improvises during calls** — Adapts to unexpected directions or questions without looking to Lead for approval
- ✅ **Handles scope/priority discussions strategically** — Can negotiate trade-offs, push back diplomatically, or redirect conversations when needed
- ✅ **Proactively addresses customer concerns** — Identifies and resolves blockers or confusion before they escalate
- ✅ **Demonstrates "why" knowledge, not just "what"** — Explains strategic rationale behind design decisions, not just describing execution
- ✅ **Anticipates customer needs** — Prepares materials, addresses potential questions, and surfaces risks before customers ask

### Autonomy & Confidence

**Symptoms that show the Associate is self-sufficient:**

- ✅ **Successfully recovers from mistakes in real-time** — Handles misunderstandings, incorrect assumptions, or unexpected pushback gracefully during live calls
- ✅ **Makes judgment calls during meetings** — Commits to decisions or directions during calls without deferring everything to "let me check with [Lead]"
- ✅ **Navigates stakeholder dynamics** — Reads the room, manages conflicting opinions, and knows when to escalate vs. resolve independently
- ✅ **Leads meeting flow and time management** — Naturally controls agenda, redirects off-topic discussions, and ensures meetings stay productive
- ✅ **Minimal post-call corrections needed** — Lead reviews call recording and finds little to no strategic misalignment or cleanup required

### Quality & Consistency

**Symptoms that show sustained high performance:**

- ✅ **Consistent customer satisfaction scores** — Customer feedback remains strong (>8/10) across multiple calls without Lead presence
- ✅ **Zero critical errors in customer commitments** — Hasn't made promises, timelines, or scope decisions that required Lead intervention
- ✅ **Strong preparation without oversight** — Pre-call materials (slides, prototypes, agendas) are consistently ready and strategically sound
- ✅ **Proactive escalation when needed** — Recognizes when Lead input IS required and brings them in appropriately

## Implementation Considerations

### Where to document this:
- **Option A:** Add a "Phase 4: Independent Leader" section to the existing 3-phase model in `growth-framework.mdx` and `customer-delivery.mdx`
- **Option B:** Create a dedicated section called "Lead-Optional Call Readiness" within the Growth Framework
- **Option C:** Add this as a milestone marker within Month 9-12 Advanced stage

### Suggested transition criteria:
- Associate must demonstrate **80%+ of the readiness indicators** consistently across 4-6 calls
- Lead observes (live or via recording) at least 2 fully independent calls with strong performance
- Customer Success confirms customer satisfaction remains high
- Associate explicitly requests independent call ownership (not automatically granted)

### Safety mechanisms:
- Lead reviews all call recordings asynchronously for first 3-4 independent calls
- Associate has clear escalation path for complex situations (can pull Lead in mid-call if needed)
- Regular check-ins to ensure Associate doesn't feel overwhelmed

## Next Steps

1. Review and refine these readiness indicators with Leadership (Alex, Mica, Leads)
2. Decide on documentation location and structure
3. Define clear process for transitioning Associates to independent call leadership
4. Add this to Growth Framework and update Customer Delivery process docs
5. Create template/checklist for Leads to assess Associate readiness
