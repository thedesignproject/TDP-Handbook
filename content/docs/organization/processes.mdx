## Escalation Flow

### Customer Issues
```
Junior → Lead Designer → Mica → Resolution
```
<Callout type="info">
Mica supports customer success escalations but is **not** a reporting line.
</Callout>

### Management Issues
```
Lead Designer → Alex
```

### Design Questions
Addressed in Design Review with Dianne and Mica as advisors. Lead designers are expected to proactively leverage Mica/Dianne/Alex help when they need it.

## Weekly Quality Checks

| Element | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Random Channel Review** | Dianne and Mica each review one random customer channel weekly |
| **Focus** | Communication quality, deliverable standards, process adherence |
| **Feedback** | Delivered to Team Leads or the operations channel (never directly to junior designers) |

## Sales to Operations Handoff

### Process Flow

| Stage | Owner | Actions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| During Sales | Dianne | Shares context immediately after promising sales calls (recordings, customer needs, requirements) via project management system |
| Deal Closure | Team | Full visibility and context before payment confirmation |
| Expectation Meeting | Mica | Conducts with new customer, incorporating Lead Designer feedback |
| Designer Assignment | Luli/Delfi | Own assignment decisions based on project requirements, team skills/capacity, customer-designer fit |
| Escalation | Lead Designers | Propose solutions to Alex when challenges arise |

### Key Points

- Early visibility allows team preparation before deals close
- Lead Designers have full accountability for assignment decisions
- Alex provides operational support when needed

## Communication Rules

### Do

- Maintain clear reporting lines (no skip-level communication to juniors)
- Escalate issues as they arise during the week (don't wait for Monday)
- Use advisors (Dianne/Mica) for expertise and guidance
- Document learnings in SOPs after resolving escalations

### Don't

- Bypass team leads to communicate with juniors
- Hold onto problems until scheduled meetings
- Create parallel or unofficial communication channels
