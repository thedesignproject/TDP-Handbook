## Designer Transfer Process

### Overview

When transferring customers from one designer to another (e.g., due to workload rebalancing, leave, or team changes), follow this structured 7-9 week handoff process to ensure continuity and maintain customer relationships.

### Process Timeline

| Week | Phase | Activities | Participants |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Week 1** | Documentation | Prepare comprehensive onboarding documentation for incoming designer | Outgoing Designer |
| **Week 2** | Knowledge Transfer | Hold KT meeting to review documentation, customer context, project status, and ongoing work | Both Designers |
| **Week 3** | Shadow & Observe | Working session: Outgoing designer leads all work while incoming designer observes | Both Designers |
| **Week 4** | Shadow & Observe | Working session: Outgoing designer leads all work while incoming designer observes | Both Designers |
| **Week 5** | Supervised Practice | Incoming designer takes over background work, outgoing designer reviews all outputs | Both Designers |
| **Week 6** | Supervised Practice | Incoming designer continues background work, outgoing designer reviews all outputs | Both Designers |
| **Week 7-9** | Customer Introduction | Gradually introduce incoming designer in customer meetings, both designers attend together | Both Designers + Customer |

### Key Practices

<Callout type="warn">
**Critical:** This is a gradual transition. Do not rush phases or skip observation periods. Customer relationships require careful handoff.
</Callout>

**Documentation Phase (Week 1)**
- Document all active projects and their status
- List customer preferences, communication style, and key contacts
- Include technical setup, tools, and access information
- Share meeting cadences and recurring commitments
- Note any ongoing issues or areas requiring attention

**Knowledge Transfer (Week 2)**
- Review all documentation together
- Answer questions and clarify context
- Share recordings from recent customer interactions
- Discuss customer personality, expectations, and relationship dynamics

**Observation Period (Weeks 3-4)**
- Incoming designer joins all meetings and work sessions
- Outgoing designer maintains full responsibility
- Incoming designer takes notes and asks clarifying questions
- Goal: Build confidence and understanding before taking over

**Supervised Transition (Weeks 5-6)**
- Incoming designer takes ownership of deliverables
- Outgoing designer reviews work before customer delivery
- Regular check-ins to address questions
- Outgoing designer remains available for support

**Customer Introduction (Weeks 7-9)**
- Both designers attend all customer meetings together
- Gradually shift meeting leadership to incoming designer
- Outgoing designer provides backup and support
- Ensure customer feels confident in the transition

### Success Criteria

- Customer feels supported and informed throughout transition
- No drop in deliverable quality or communication standards
- Incoming designer has full context on customer relationship and ongoing work
- Clean handoff with documented processes and project status

## Communication Rules

### Do

- Maintain clear reporting lines (no skip-level communication to juniors)
- Escalate issues as they arise during the week (don't wait for Monday)
- Use advisors (Dianne/Mica) for expertise and guidance
- Document learnings in SOPs after resolving escalations

### Don't

- Bypass team leads to communicate with juniors
- Hold onto problems until scheduled meetings
- Create parallel or unofficial communication channels
