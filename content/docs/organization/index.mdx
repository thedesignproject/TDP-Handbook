description: Organizational structure and operational framework for TDP
---

This document establishes TDP's organizational structure and operational framework to enhance efficiency, accountability, and design quality across our team.

## Key Structure

TDP operates under a clear hierarchical model with Alex serving as Director overseeing all operations, supported by specialized leadership roles:

- **Dianne** (Commercial Lead) — Managing all sales activities
- **Mica** (Customer Success Lead) — Handling customer success, recruiting, and CDO for customers
- **Luli & Delfi** (Lead Designers / Team Leads) — Managing junior designers and maintaining day-to-day design operations

## Core Principles

- **Clear reporting lines:** Junior designers communicate exclusively through their assigned Lead Designer, preventing skip-level communication and ensuring consistent management
- **Defined escalation paths:** Customer issues flow from Junior → Lead → Mica, while management challenges go directly to Alex
- **Quality assurance:** Weekly random channel reviews by Dianne and Mica ensure consistent standards across all customer deliverables
- **Continuous improvement:** Regular Design Review meetings foster knowledge sharing, feedback loops, and AI integration advancement

## Expected Outcomes

This structure aims to enable lead designers to effectively manage increasing numbers of associate designers, creating scalability that drives business profitability and value.

By establishing clear operational frameworks, delegation paths, and support systems, we seek to expand team capacity while maintaining quality standards.

Success will be measured not just by output metrics, but by our ability to develop junior talent, reduce burnout through effective delegation, and create a work environment where designers can thrive while delivering exceptional customer value.
