title: Asana Knowledge Hub
description: Creating comprehensive customer context documentation for design team handoff
---

**Owner:** Dianne (Customer Success Lead)
**Timing:** After Expectations Meeting, before design team onboarding

## Purpose

The Asana Knowledge Hub is a comprehensive documentation process that consolidates all customer context into a structured format. This ensures the design team receives complete, organized information before beginning their work, eliminating information gaps and enabling them to start with full strategic context.

## Input Sources

The Knowledge Hub synthesizes information from multiple sources:

- **Sales Meeting** notes and transcripts (Dianne's meeting)
- **Expectations Meeting** notes and transcript
- **Customer website** and public materials
- **External research** (Crunchbase, funding announcements, press releases, etc.)
- Any other relevant context gathered during the onboarding process

<Callout type="warn">
**Critical:** All information must come from these verified sources. Do not invent, assume, or extrapolate information not explicitly found in the materials.
</Callout>

---

## Process Steps

### 1. Gather All Materials

Collect transcripts, notes, and research from:
- Sales meeting with Dianne
- Expectations Meeting
- Customer website exploration
- Crunchbase or similar research platforms

### 2. Use Claude to Structure Information

- Paste all gathered materials into Claude
- Provide the 10-section template (below)
- Ask Claude to fill in the template using **only** the information from provided materials

### 3. Important Instructions for Claude

When using Claude to create the Knowledge Hub, include these critical instructions:

> "Fill in the following template using ONLY information from the materials provided. Do not invent, assume, or extrapolate any information. If a section cannot be filled with the available information, note 'Information not provided' rather than making assumptions. Reference specific sources when filling in each section."

<Callout type="warn">
**Watch for hallucinations:** Claude sometimes invents information to fill gaps. Always verify outputs against source materials. If something seems too specific or wasn't discussed, remove it.
</Callout>

### 4. Review and Verify

- Cross-check all information against source materials
- Remove any assumptions or invented details
- Ensure everything is traceable to a specific conversation or document

### 5. Document in Asana

- Create the Knowledge Hub in the customer's Asana project
- Add to the Knowledge Tab with links to all source materials
- Make accessible to the design team

## Handoff to Design Team

Once the Knowledge Hub is complete:

1. **Share in Asana** — Add to the customer's project Knowledge Tab
2. **Notify design team** — Alert the assigned Lead that the Knowledge Hub is ready
3. **Make available before onboarding** — Ensure this is accessible before Step 1 (Onboarding) in the [Process Workflow](/docs/sop/process)
4. **Reference in kickoff** — Design Lead uses this to prepare for Step 3 (Customer Kickoff)

<Callout type="info">
The Knowledge Hub becomes the single source of truth for customer context. The design team should reference it throughout the engagement to stay aligned with business objectives and customer needs.

## Best Practices

### Do's ✓
- Cite specific sources for information
- Note when information is not available rather than guessing
- Include direct quotes from customer when particularly insightful
- Cross-reference between Sales and Expectations meetings for consistency
- Update the Knowledge Hub as new information becomes available

### Don'ts ✗
- Invent details to complete sections
- Make assumptions about business model or metrics
- Extrapolate beyond what was explicitly stated
- Skip verification against source materials
- Leave sections empty without noting "Information not provided"
