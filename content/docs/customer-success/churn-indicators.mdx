title: Churn Indicators
description: Early warning signs that a customer partnership may be at risk
---

**Owner:** Dianne (Customer Success Lead) + Design Leads

## Purpose

Churn indicators are early warning signs that a customer relationship may be deteriorating. Identifying these patterns early allows the Customer Success and design teams to intervene proactively, address concerns, and strengthen the partnership before it's too late.

## How to Use This Guide

- **Design Leads & Associates:** Watch for these indicators during day-to-day work and escalate concerns to Customer Success
- **Customer Success:** Monitor for these patterns during monthly check-ins and through designer feedback
- **Action Required:** When multiple indicators appear, initiate a conversation with the customer to understand concerns and realign

---

## Onboarding

Early signals during the initial customer onboarding phase:

- Expectations meeting feels forced
- Poor onboarding experience
- Unimpressive first deliverable
- No clear success metrics established
- Customer asks to skip kickoff and rush through deliverables

<Callout type="warn">
**Critical Period:** The first 30-60 days set the tone for the entire partnership. Address onboarding issues immediately.
</Callout>

---

## Company

Changes in the customer's company that may impact the partnership:

- Recent funding changes (failed raise, down round, or unexpected windfall)
- Shift in company priorities or strategic direction
- Company layoffs or organizational restructuring
- Leadership changes at executive level

---

## Engagement & Communication

Changes in how the customer communicates and engages:

- **Response times getting longer over time**
- **Shorter, more transactional replies**
- Stops asking questions or requesting context — just approves things passively
- CC's more people on emails (sign of lack of trust or CYA behavior)
- Switches from sync to only async communication
- Customer started on a short commitment (monthly vs. quarterly vs. annual)
- Designer keeps following up with no response
- Customer constantly pushes meetings
- Decreasing meeting attendance or engagement during calls

<Callout type="info">
**Pattern Recognition:** A single missed meeting isn't a red flag, but consistent patterns over 2-3 weeks signal trouble.
</Callout>

## Scope & Value Perception

Signs the customer is questioning the value or cost of the partnership:

- Starts questioning costs or asking for itemized breakdowns they didn't ask for before
- Requests get smaller or less strategic (tactical tweaks vs. value-driving projects)
- Stops involving designer in valuable conversations (strategy sessions, roadmap planning)
- Mentions budget cuts, restructuring, or hiring in-house designers
- Asks for source files or asset handoffs outside normal cadence
- Not having roadmap visibility or understanding of product's bigger picture
- Customer stops mentioning future involvement ("next quarter", "when we scale")

---

## Relationship Quality

Deterioration in the quality of the working relationship:

- **Main POC leaves the company or changes roles**
- New stakeholders enter who weren't part of onboarding
- Feedback becomes vague ("it's fine" vs. engaged critique)
- Stops sharing wins or celebrating launches together
- Tension around revisions that didn't exist before
- Not having a personal relationship with main POC
- Relationship feels purely transactional

---

## Behavioral Patterns

Administrative and contractual warning signs:

- Payment delays or invoicing questions
- Contract renewal conversations keep getting pushed
- Has questions about partnership length or commitment terms
- Asks about cancellation policies or off-boarding process

---

## Designer's Feeling

Gut instincts from the designer working with the customer:

- Designer feels like they're "servicing" rather than "partnering"
- Work feels like it's on autopilot
- Customer sounds tired or distracted during calls
- Designer hesitates before pushing back on ideas
- Designer would not feel comfortable asking for a referral
- Sense that something is "off" even if nothing specific can be pinpointed

<Callout type="warn">
**Trust Designer Intuition:** Designers work closest with customers daily. If they sense something is wrong, take it seriously.
</Callout>

## What to Do When You Spot Indicators

### 1. Document Patterns
- Note specific examples and dates
- Track multiple indicators, not just one isolated incident
- Share observations with Customer Success

### 2. Internal Discussion
- Designer discusses concerns with their Lead (if Associate flagged it)
- Lead discusses with Customer Success
- Assess severity and determine intervention approach

### 3. Customer Conversation
Customer Success Lead or Designer Lead schedules a conversation:
- Express genuine care for their success
- Ask open-ended questions: "How are you feeling about the partnership?"
- Listen for underlying concerns (budget, value, fit, internal changes)
- Collaborate on solutions

### 4. Action Plan
Based on the conversation:
- Realign on goals and success metrics
- Adjust scope, deliverables, or meeting cadence
- Bring in additional support (Fractional CDO, strategic planning)
- In some cases, gracefully help them transition if the fit isn't right

## Prevention is Key

The best way to prevent churn is to build strong partnerships from the start:

- Set clear expectations during [Expectations Meeting](/docs/customer-success/expectations-meeting)
- Create comprehensive context with [Asana Knowledge Hub](/docs/customer-success/asana-knowledge-hub)
- Maintain regular [communication cadence](/docs/sop/process/communication-standards)
- Build genuine relationships, not just transactional interactions
- Deliver consistent value and celebrate wins together
- Conduct proactive monthly check-ins (don't wait for problems)

<Callout type="info">
**Remember:** Some churn is healthy. Not every customer is the right fit, and identifying that early is valuable for both parties.
