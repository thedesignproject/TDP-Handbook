## When Customer Success Engages

Customer Success begins immediately after a customer signs up and payment is confirmed. The CS Lead conducts an Expectations Meeting to:

- Understand the company context and business objectives
- Identify how design impacts those objectives
- Set foundations for a strong partnership
- Gather information that sets the design team up for success

This context is then documented and handed off to the design team before their kickoff, ensuring everyone starts aligned.

<Callout type="info">
The Expectations Meeting happens **before** the design team's Customer Kickoff (Step 3 in the [Process Workflow](/docs/sop/process)). This ensures the design team receives comprehensive context before their first customer interaction.
