title: Lead Responsibilities
description: Design Lead role definition, expectations, and time allocation
---

The Lead owns customer relationships and strategy while providing mentorship to Associates.

## Time Allocation

| Focus Area | Time | Key Activities |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Customer Relationship | 60% | Primary contact, meetings, project management |
| Strategy & UX | 25% | Product strategy, design decisions, research |
| Mentorship & Team | 15% | Daily feedback, growth check-ins, learning opportunities |

---

## Customer Relationship (60% of time)

- Primary point of contact and trusted partner
- Lead all customer meetings and strategic discussions
- Own customer success and satisfaction
- Manage project timelines and deliverables
- May reduce meeting frequency with a customer (e.g., from 2 hours → 1 hour/week) as long as Customer Success is informed and customer communication is clear

## Strategy & UX (25% of time)

- Guide overall product strategy and user experience
- Make high-level design decisions
- Conduct user research and strategic planning
- Define design system and standards

## Mentorship & Team (15% of time)

- Provide daily feedback to Associate
- Conduct weekly growth check-ins
- Create learning opportunities
- Escalate performance issues to Design Manager

---

## Meeting Load Limits

- **Target:** ~1 hour/week of live meetings per customer
- Some Leads may currently be at 1.5–2 hours until more delegation to Associates is in place
- Leads can reduce meeting time with customers when appropriate, looping in Customer Success
- Use Loom for non-critical updates and feedback
- Decline non-essential internal meetings
- Focus meetings only on strategic decisions and complex feedback
