description: Design Associate role definition, expectations, and capacity guidelines
---

Associates focus on execution under mentorship while building skills toward increased autonomy.

## Time Allocation

| Focus Area | Time | Key Activities |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Design Execution | 80% | Creating designs, iterating, maintaining systems |
| Communication & Learning | 10% | Daily updates, watching recordings, growth activities |
| Team Collaboration | 10% | Contributing ideas, proposing improvements |

---

## Design Execution (80% of time)

- Create high-quality designs based on Lead's direction
- Iterate on designs based on feedback
- Maintain design systems and component libraries
- Deliver pixel-perfect, developer-ready assets

## Communication & Learning (10% of time)

- Daily Loom/Slack updates to Lead
- Watch ALL customer meeting recordings within 24 hours
- Submit post-meeting questions to Lead via Asana
- Monthly growth check-ins
- Study UX fundamentals to improve handoff understanding
- Ask questions and seek clarity proactively
- Document decisions and learnings in Asana/Figma

## Team Collaboration (10% of time)

- Work as a team, not rigid role division — contribute ideas and solutions
- Propose improvements and optimizations
- Research design trends and best practices
- Take initiative on process improvements
- Support Lead with strategic thinking when ready

---

## Capacity Guidelines

### Standard Capacity: 3 Customers
This is the baseline expectation for all Associates.

### Milestone Capacity: 4 Customers
Managing 4 customers is treated as a **performance milestone** tied to growth and potential salary progression (not a temporary exception or pilot).

Associates may move to 4 customers only when:
- They explicitly request the additional workload
- The Lead and HOD confirm that quality, communication, and consistency are strong enough to scale
- The Associate has demonstrated readiness through stable performance, ownership, and reliability

<Callout type="warn">
4-customer capacity is **not automatic** — it reflects sustained growth and must be approved.
</Callout>
