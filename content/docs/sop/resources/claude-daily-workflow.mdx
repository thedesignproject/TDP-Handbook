title: Claude as Your Daily Thinking Partner
description: Using Claude throughout your daily workflow to clarify thinking, validate understanding, and move faster
---

**The Goal:** Never get stuck in silence. If you're confused, talk to Claude. If you're blocked, talk to Claude. If you need to validate, talk to Claude.

---

## The Core Method: Talk to Claude, A Lot

Don't try to figure everything out alone. Use Claude as your thinking partner throughout the process:

### 1. Share Transcripts

After every meeting, paste the transcript and ask Claude to help you extract what matters:
- Decisions made
- Open questions
- Action items
- Design requirements

**Example prompt:** "What are the key decisions and action items from this meeting?"

### 2. Validate Your Understanding

Before designing, talk through what you think the requirements are. Claude can catch misunderstandings early.

**Example prompt:** "Here's what I understand the requirements to be: [your understanding]. What's still unclear? What should I ask the stakeholders?"

### 3. Ask Questions Constantly

If something is unclear, ask. Don't assume. Claude can help you figure out what questions to ask stakeholders too.

### 4. Be Visual

Always turn conversations into something visual (flows, wireframes, prototypes). Words are ambiguous; screens are concrete.

**Example prompt:** "Help me turn this into a user flow / wireframe structure"

### 5. Focus on Action Items

Every conversation should end with clear next steps:
- What are you delivering?
- By when?
- To whom?

## Pro Tip: Use Voice Dictation

Since thinking happens in multiple languages and typing takes time, use a tool like **Wispr Flow** to dictate:

1. Press a button
2. Talk (in Spanish or English)
3. It transcribes for you

This removes the friction of typing and lets you think out loud.

## When NOT to Use This Workflow

This daily workflow is for **regular design work**. For deep research tasks (user research synthesis, complex design critiques, competitive analysis), use the [LLM Council](/docs/sop/resources/llm-council) instead.

## Remember

Claude is your thinking partner, not a replacement for your judgment. Use it to:
- Clarify thinking
- Validate understanding
- Move faster
- Avoid getting stuck

Always review Claude's output with your Lead before sharing with customers.
