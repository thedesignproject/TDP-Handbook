Solutions for common challenges in the Lead & Associate model.

---

## UX Education for Associates

**Problem:** Associates not understanding UX limits Lead's handoff effectiveness and trust.

**Solution:**

| Timeline | Action |
| :---- | :---- |
| Week 1-2 | Associate completes standardized UX fundamentals training using recorded training videos (not customized by Lead). Lead only answers clarifying questions. |
| Ongoing | Associate watches ALL customer meeting recordings to understand strategic thinking |
| Monthly | Associate presents UX analysis of current customer project to Lead |
| Quarterly | Associate shadows design lead while executing to understand strategy |

## Team Collaboration Over Role Division

**Problem:** Rigid role separation prevents effective teamwork.

**Solution:**

- **Daily standups:** Both Lead and Associate contribute ideas and solutions
- **Shared accountability:** Both responsible for customer success, not just their "role"
- **Cross-training:** Associate learns strategy, Lead stays connected to execution
- **Flexible boundaries:** Adjust responsibilities based on project needs and Associate growth

## Lead Time Management

**Problem:** Leads still taking too many hours, limiting scalability.

**Solution:**

| Action | How |
| :---- | :---- |
| Meeting limit | Strict 1-hour limit per customer per week |
| Delegation checklist | Reference what can/cannot be handed off |
| Time audits | Monthly track where Lead hours go beyond meetings |
| Progressive handoffs | Gradually increase Associate autonomy to reduce Lead involvement |

### Transitioning Long-Term / Sensitive Customers

- Customer Success must communicate transitions early, especially for long-standing relationships
- Transition should not be rushed; customer communication can begin immediately, but actual transition may happen later
- Expect **2-3 weeks of overlap** ("double work") where Lead and Associate attend calls together and share design work
- Lead will temporarily exceed normal capacity during overlap; this is expected and communicated to customer
- After overlap, Associate gradually takes over day-to-day calls while Lead remains available for strategic guidance and escalations

## Accountability System

**Problem:** No clear owner for making sure the model succeeds.

**Solution:** Three simple owners:

### DesignOps (Alex)
- Weekly: "Are reviews happening?"
- Monthly: "Is the model working?" (15-min survey)
- Quarterly: Adjust based on reality

### Leads
- Show up for reviews
- Create briefs before assigning work
- Flag when system breaks

### Associates
- Book review slots
- Ask for help when stuck
- Say "I don't understand" when confused

<Callout type="info">
**The Friday Check:** Every Friday, DesignOps sends one Slack message: "How was the Lead/Associate collaboration this week? Green/Yellow/Red"
</Callout>

## Making Process Stick

**Problem:** We have processes but no one follows them.

**Solution:** Start with ONE process and make it sacred.

### Example: Design Reviews

| Element | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| When | Every Tuesday/Thursday 3-5pm |
| What | 30-min slots bookable by Associates |
| How | Use the same Figma template every time |
| Track | Simple spreadsheet — did it happen? Yes/No |

**After 2 weeks:**
- If 80%+ happened → add next process
- If under 80% → fix this one first

<Callout type="warn">
Stop creating new processes until the current one works.
</Callout>
