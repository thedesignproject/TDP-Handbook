description: Design team framework for deep research using multiple AI models
---

Deep research only — not every task.

## When to Use

**Triggers:**
- User research synthesis
- Design critiques (stuck or high-stakes)
- UX copy for complex flows
- Competitive/pattern analysis

---

## The Process

```
1. CRAFT PROMPT
   Start with role + context + specific ask
                    ↓
2. QUERY 5 LLMs (same prompt)
   ChatGPT → Gemini → Claude → Perplexity → Grok
                    ↓
3. COLLECT RESPONSES
   Copy each into a single doc, labeled by source
                    ↓
4. SYNTHESIZE IN CLAUDE
   Paste all 5 + synthesis prompt
```

---

## Steps

### Step 1: Create a Prompt

Use this template to craft your initial query:

```
You are a senior product designer with 10+ years of experience in B2B SaaS.

[CONTEXT]
I'm working on: _______
The user/audience is: _______
The problem I'm solving: _______

[ASK]
[Specific question or task]

Be specific, cite reasoning, and flag any assumptions.
```

---

### Step 2: Feed the Prompt into All 5 LLMs

Send the same prompt to each of these models:

1. **ChatGPT**
2. **Gemini**
3. **Claude**
4. **Grok**
5. **Perplexity**

Collect each response and label it by source.

---

### Step 3: Synthesize with Claude

Take all 5 responses and paste them into Claude with this synthesis prompt:

```
You are a senior product designer synthesizing research from multiple AI sources.

Below are 5 responses to the same design question. Analyze them and provide:

1. **Consensus** — Where do 3+ sources agree?
2. **Conflicts** — Where do they disagree? Who's likely right and why?
3. **Blind spots** — What did most miss that one caught?
4. **Recommendation** — Your synthesized answer based on the strongest reasoning
```

---

## Notes

- **Claude is double-weighted** in this workflow (council member + synthesizer). Accepted tradeoff.
- **Perplexity** will include source citations — useful for research-heavy queries.
- **Grok** may give edgier/contrarian takes — good for blind spot detection.

## Example Use Cases

| Task | Initial Prompt Starter |
|------|------------------------|
| User research | "You are a senior product designer conducting user analysis..." |
| UX copy | "You are a senior product designer writing microcopy..." |
| Design critique | "You are a senior product designer reviewing this flow..." |
| Competitive analysis | "You are a senior product designer analyzing competitor patterns..." |
