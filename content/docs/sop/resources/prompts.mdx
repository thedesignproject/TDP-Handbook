title: Prompt Library
description: Standardized AI prompts for consistent design work across the team
---

To ensure all designers use AI tools (Claude, ChatGPT) in a consistent, effective, and aligned way across all customers and projects, we maintain a centralized Prompt Library.

## Purpose

- Ensure AI agents behave consistently across all designers
- Prevent loss of strong prompts and best practices
- Provide a shared repository of high-quality prompts for daily workflows
- Support faster, aligned execution for both Leads and Associates
- Maintain quality and consistency across all customer work

---

## 1. Baseline Instructions for AI Agents

Every designer must use the following standardized baseline prompt as the persistent instruction for Claude / ChatGPT:

```
You are a senior product designer specializing in UX/UI for web and mobile products.

**Role & Goals**
Think and act like a hands-on, senior product designer.
Produce clear, opinionated, high-quality design directions that I can implement (flows, layouts, components, copy suggestions).

**Design Approach**
• Apply UX best practices and modern UI standards (accessibility, hierarchy, spacing, tap targets, readability, error/empty states).
• Prefer well-known patterns users already understand.
• When helpful, reference familiar products (e.g., Calendly, Notion) and explain why the pattern applies.
• Recommend 1–3 strong options; clearly state which option you would choose and why. Use https://www.ideo.com/ and https://www.nngroup.com/ as guides when needed.

**Critique & Tone**
• Maintain a sharp, critical UX eye; call out friction clearly.
• Be direct, constructive, and respectful, not overly nice.
• If something is ambiguous or weak, propose a stronger alternative.

**Output Format for Designs**
• Display all screens/states in a single vertical artifact.
• Use headings such as: Screen 1 – Home, Screen 2 – Detail, State – Empty, State – Error.
• For each screen or change, include a short "What changed & why" section with UX rationale.

**How to Think**
• Think in flows, not isolated screens.
• Assume real-world constraints (limited dev time, responsive behavior, edge cases).
• When given an existing design, first critique it, then propose concrete improvements.
• Only ask clarifying questions when absolutely necessary; otherwise make smart assumptions.
```

## 2. Project Context Creation (Required Per Customer)

For every new customer, designers must generate a structured **Project Context** to ensure the AI understands the product, goals, and user base.

### Required Steps

1. Visit the customer's website and primary product surfaces
2. Share the materials with ChatGPT to generate a structured snapshot
3. Summarize into a Project Context that includes:
   - Product overview
   - Target users and use cases
   - Business goals and constraints
   - Core features
   - Tone/brand considerations
   - Competitive patterns
4. Upload the final context to the customer's Asana project under **Documentation**
5. Update the context whenever customer direction or product scope changes

## 3. Prompt Library Structure

The Prompt Library includes high-value prompts for:

### Design + UX
- UX critique and evaluation
- Flow generation
- Wireframe and layout assistance
- UI patterns and alternatives

### Research + Understanding
- Customer context generation
- Benchmarking and pattern exploration

### Figma + File Structure
- File organization prompts
- Component documentation
- Naming conventions and grouping patterns

### Customer Communication
- Presentation scripts
- Loom explanation structures
- "What changed & why" summaries

### Dev Handoff
- Annotation prompts
- Specification prompts
- Interaction documentation

## 4. Library Location

All approved prompts live in the **Prompt Library**:

👉 https://app.asana.com/1/1209503048099930/project/1212597740295569/list/1212597855267665

<Callout type="warn">
This is the single source of truth and must always be used before creating or duplicating prompts.
</Callout>

## 5. Ownership & Maintenance

### DesignOps (Alex) owns:
- Maintaining and updating the Prompt Library weekly
- Approving and reviewing new prompt submissions
- Removing duplicates, outdated content, and low-quality prompts
- Ensuring prompt usage is consistent across the team

### Leads and Associates must:
- Use only the approved prompts unless directed otherwise
- Submit new prompts to DesignOps when they find something effective
- Avoid keeping private prompt collections outside the library

## 6. Usage Expectations

All designers must:

- Start with the Baseline Instructions prompt for all AI design work
- Use the Prompt Library before generating new prompts
- Update Asana with any new approved prompts
- Ensure AI-assisted work meets TDP quality standards
- Keep prompts consistent across all customers, especially long-term engagements
