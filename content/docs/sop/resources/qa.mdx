Critical questions and answers for working within the Lead & Associate model.

---

## Q1: Who does what between Lead and Associate, and when does that change?

**A:** Depends on project stage AND Associate phase.

### Role Ownership (All Phases)

**Lead: Strategy & Quality**
- Client calls about direction
- Prioritization decisions
- Concept development
- Final approval before client sees it
- "Why" and "What" decisions

**Associate: Execution & Production**
- Design creation and iteration
- Asset preparation
- Implementing feedback
- "How" decisions (patterns, inspiration)
- Proactive communication with Lead

### Customer Presentation Phases

| Phase | Timeline | Lead Role | Associate Role |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Phase 1 | Months 1-2 | Presents everything | Watches and learns |
| Phase 2 | Months 3-5 | Presents "Why we built it" | Presents "What we built" |
| Phase 3 | Month 6+ | Reviews beforehand, advises | Owns entire presentation |

**Transition criteria for Phase 2:** Quality consistent, customer satisfaction >8/10

<Callout type="info">
**Stop asking** "Can I decide this?"
**Start asking** "Does this need strategy or execution?"
</Callout>

## Q2: How do I track projects and capacity across multiple customers?

**A:** Use the unified dashboard as your single source of truth.

**Find it:** Asana → Portfolios → "Lead Capacity Dashboard"

**What you'll see:**
- All customer projects in one view
- Lead + Associate assigned
- Weekly meeting hours per customer
- Project phase + status

### Usage by Role

| Role | Frequency | Actions |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Leads | Every Monday, 5 min | Filter by name, check if >1hr/week per customer |
| HOD | Before assignments | Check capacity, target under 3 customers |
| Associates | Optional | Lead will inform of priority shifts |

## Q3: Where do I find templates and who maintains them?

**A:** Alex owns the infrastructure. Templates live in one place.

**Find templates:** Asana → "TDP Lead/Associate Resources" project

### The Core Templates

1. **Customer Kickoff Notes** — First meeting (Lead fills out)
2. **UX Canvas** — Needs rethinking
3. **Figma templates** — Best practices for file structure
4. **Daily Associate Update** — Every EOD (Associate)
5. **Weekly Check-in Agenda** — Every Wednesday, 30min (Both)
6. **Customer Delivery Presentation** — Customer presentations
7. **Dev Handoff & Documentation** — Design to dev (Associate, Lead reviews)
8. **Feedback Review Template** — Monthly check-in (Both)

**Contact Alex when:**
- SOP contradicts reality
- Process question not answered
- Stuck on templates/tools
- Template is missing

## Q4: How does work move from Lead to Associate and back?

**A:** Use the 3-Touch System for every piece of work.

### Touch 1: Brief (Lead → Associate)
- **When:** Start of new work
- **Must include:** Goal, Constraints, First deliverable, Internal due date, External deadline

### Touch 2: Review (Associate → Lead)
- **When:** Work ready for feedback
- **Checkpoints:** Before starting, 50%, 90%, 100%

### Touch 3: Approval (Lead → Client)
- **When:** Lead-approved and ready
- **Formats:** Meeting, Loom, or Slack

## Q5: I'm spending 2 hours/week with customers. Am I doing something wrong?

**A:** No — but you need a delegation plan to reach the 1-hour target.

**Current reality:**
- Target: 1hr/week per customer
- Actual: Most Leads at 1.5-2hrs
- Goal: 60 days to reach ≤1.25hrs average

### Action Plan

**Step 1: Track actual hours**
- Check calendar from last week
- Break down: Meetings? Prep? Slack? Feedback?

**Step 2: Identify what to delegate**
- Status calls → Associate leads by Month 3-4
- Design walkthroughs → Co-present strategy/execution
- Slack responses → Associate drafts, you review
- Figma feedback → Associate first pass

**Step 3: Make 30-day plan**
- Pick ONE thing to delegate this month
- Set success criteria
- Coach: Shadow 2x → Co-lead 1x → Solo 1x

## Q6: Which scheduling tool does the team use?

**A:** All team members must use **Cal.com** as the standard scheduling tool.

- Every new hire creates a Cal.com account during onboarding
- All team members maintain an active Cal.com profile
- All recruiting, client, and internal meetings booked via Cal.com links

---

## Q7: What can vs. cannot be delegated to an Associate?

**A:** See the complete [delegation checklist](/docs/sop/roles/lead#what-can-be-delegated-to-associates).

**Quick summary:**
- **CAN delegate:** Execution, production, iteration, preparation
- **CANNOT delegate:** Strategy, customer relationship, direction-setting

---

## Q8: What are the required steps before going Out-of-Office?

**A:** We offer flexible time off. Coordinate early with your Design Lead.

- **Maximum consecutive time off:** 2 weeks
- **More than one week:** Get approval from TDP Operations Lead

### Short OOO (1-3 days)
1. Inform your Design Lead (ideally 2 weeks in advance)
2. Post in Slack #team-general using `/ooo` command
3. Add time off to shared calendar
4. Inform customer at least 2 weeks in advance

### Medium OOO (4-7 days)
All of the above, plus:
- Delegation checklist
- Delegated designer assigned
- OOO transition handoff delivered

### Long OOO (8-14 days)
**Approval required from Operations**
- Full coverage plan for all customers
- Customer introduction call with delegated designer
- Coverage plan reviewed by Lead

<Callout type="info">
All OOO announcements must be made using `/ooo` in Slack. This automatically creates an Asana task.
</Callout>

## Q9: What is the maximum length for customer meetings?

**A:** Maximum **45 minutes**.

We avoid 1-hour meetings because they reduce execution time and are rarely necessary.

If the agenda is too long:
- Prioritize discussion points
- Defer non-essential topics
- Move items to async
- Schedule follow-up only when strictly needed

---

## Q10: How are Story Points assigned?

**A:** Use this standardized scale:

| Size | Time | Points |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| XXS | 30 min | 1 SP |
| XS | 2 hrs | 2 SP |
| S | 4 hrs | 3 SP |
| M | 6 hrs | 5 SP |
| L | 8 hrs | 8 SP |
| XL | 10+ hrs | 13 SP |
