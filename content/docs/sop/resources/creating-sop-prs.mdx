description: Complete step-by-step guide for using Claude Code to create and submit SOP updates
---

This guide walks you through the complete process of creating SOP pull requests using Claude Code, from connecting your repository to sharing your PR for review.

---

## Prerequisites: Connecting the TDP-Handbook Repository

Before you can create PRs, you need to connect the TDP-Handbook repository to Claude Code.

### Step 1: Access Claude Code

1. Open Claude (claude.ai)
2. Navigate to the project/repository section
3. You should see a list of repositories or an option to add one

### Step 2: Connect the Repository

If you don't see TDP-Handbook listed:

1. Ask Claude Code directly: "How do I connect the TDP-Handbook repository to Claude Code?"
2. Claude will provide specific instructions for your setup
3. Follow the authentication steps provided
4. Once connected, you'll see "TDP-Handbook" appear in your repository list

## Method 1: Creating PRs with Images (Recommended for Visual Content)

Use this method when you have screenshots, photos, or visual content to add to the SOP.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Content

1. Take clear screenshots or photos of the content you want to add
2. Make sure text is readable and images are high quality
3. Organize images in the order you want them presented

### Step 2: Upload to Claude Code

1. In your Claude Code conversation, click the attachment/upload button
2. Select all your images
3. Upload them to the conversation

### Step 3: Give Claude Clear Instructions

Type this prompt (customize as needed):

```
Help me create a new PR using the images attached.

Make sure that no data/info are being duplicated on the current SOP.

Let me know where will you put these.

And before creating PR, consult with me first.
```

### Step 4: Review Claude's Analysis

Claude will:
- Analyze the content in your images
- Check for duplicate information in the existing SOP
- Suggest where to place the content
- Ask you clarifying questions

**Example questions Claude might ask:**
- "Is the content accurate to what you wanted?"
- "Should I change 'Review with Lead' to 'Review with [specific name]' or keep it generic?"
- "Any additions or changes needed?"
- "Should I also update the Resources index page and meta.json to include this new page?"

### Step 5: Answer Claude's Questions

Respond to each question clearly:
- Answer yes/no questions directly
- Provide specific preferences when asked
- Confirm or adjust Claude's suggestions

### Step 6: Let Claude Create the PR

Once you've answered all questions, Claude will:
- Create the necessary files
- Update navigation files (meta.json, index.mdx)
- Commit the changes
- Push to a new branch
- Provide you with the PR link

## Method 2: Creating PRs with Text (Recommended for Text Content)

Use this method when you have text content, documentation, or written instructions to add.

### Step 1: Prepare Your Content

1. Copy the text content you want to add
2. Format it clearly with headings, bullet points, or sections
3. Note where you think it should go (if you have a preference)

### Step 2: Paste into Claude Code

Paste your content directly into the Claude Code conversation.

### Step 3: Give Claude Clear Instructions

Type this prompt:

```
Help me create a new PR with this content:

[Paste your content here]

Make sure that no data/info are being duplicated on the current SOP.

Let me know where will you put this.

And before creating PR, consult with me first.
```

### Step 4: Follow the Review Process

Same as Method 1, Steps 4-6:
- Review Claude's analysis
- Answer questions
- Confirm placement
- Let Claude create the PR

## Reviewing Your PR Before Sharing

After Claude creates the PR, you **must** review it before sharing with the team.

### Step 1: Open the PR Link

Claude will provide a GitHub link like:
```
https://github.com/thedesignproject/TDP-Handbook/pull/new/claude/[branch-name]
```

Click this link to open the PR in GitHub.

### Step 2: Review the Files Changed

1. In the PR, click the **"Files changed"** tab
2. You'll see all files that were added or modified
3. Review each section carefully:
   - Check that formatting is correct
   - Verify all information is accurate
   - Ensure headings and structure make sense
   - Look for any errors or typos

**Take your time with this step.** This is your chance to catch any issues before others see it.

### Step 3: Preview the Live Documentation

To see how your changes will look in the actual documentation site:

1. Scroll down in the PR to the checks section
2. Find the **Vercel preview deployment** (usually has a green checkmark)
3. Click **"Preview"** or **"Open link in new tab"**
4. This opens a preview of the documentation site with your changes
5. Navigate to your new/updated page
6. Check that everything renders correctly:
   - Images display properly
   - Links work
   - Tables format correctly
   - Code blocks appear as expected
   - Navigation includes your new page

**This preview is only visible to you** - it's not live yet. This is your sandbox to verify everything looks good.

### Step 4: Make Any Necessary Edits

If you spot issues during review:

1. Go back to Claude Code
2. Ask Claude to make specific changes: "Can you update [specific section] to say [new content]?"
3. Claude will update the PR
4. Review again using Steps 2-3

## Sharing Your PR for Review

Once you're satisfied with your PR, share it with the team for review.

### Step 1: Copy the PR Link

1. In your GitHub PR, click the **three dots** (⋯) in the top right
2. Select **"Copy link"**
3. The PR URL is now on your clipboard

### Step 2: Post in Slack

1. Go to Slack
2. Navigate to the **#team-operations-pr-reviews** channel
3. Post a message with your PR link:

**Template message:**
```
New PR: [Brief title of what you added/changed]

[Paste PR link]

Feel free to review and approve!
```

**Example:**
```
New PR: Add Claude Daily Workflow guide to Resources

https://github.com/thedesignproject/TDP-Handbook/pull/123

Feel free to review and approve!
```

## What Happens After You Share

1. **Team reviews your PR** in the #team-operations-pr-reviews channel
2. **Reviewers may add comments** or request changes
3. **You respond to feedback** by either:
   - Making requested changes (ask Claude Code to update)
   - Explaining your reasoning
   - Discussing alternatives
4. **Once approved**, your PR will be merged
5. **Your changes go live** on the documentation site
