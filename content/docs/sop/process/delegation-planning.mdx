**Owner:** Lead + Associate
**Timeline:** 30-60 minutes post-kickoff

## Lead Provides Associate With

- **Clear, specific tasks** with both internal and customer deadlines
- **Success criteria** and quality standards
- **Communication schedule** (daily standup + weekly check-in)
- **Escalation guidelines** (see [Risk Management](/docs/sop/management/risk-escalation))

## Associate Confirms

- Understanding of requirements
- Realistic timeline assessment
- Resource needs and blockers

## The 3-Touch System

For every piece of work, use this standardized handoff system:

### Touch 1: Brief (Lead → Associate)

**When:** Start of new work/assignment
**How:** Slack message, meeting, Asana, PRD, or Loom

Must include:
- **Goal** (what we're trying to achieve)
- **Constraints** (time, scope, technical limits)
- **First deliverable** (wireframes? hi-fi? prototype?)
- **Internal due date** (when Lead reviews)
- **External deadline** (when client sees it)

<Callout type="info">
**Example:** "Customer wants checkout redesign. Goal: Reduce cart abandonment. Constraint: Mobile first. First deliverable: 3 wireframe options by Thursday 2pm (my review). Client presentation: Monday."
</Callout>

### Touch 2: Review (Associate → Lead)

**When:** Work is ready for Lead feedback
**How:** Scheduled in Lead's Office Hours OR Asana deadline + EOD sync

Associate shows work at checkpoints:

| Checkpoint | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| Before starting | Associate is clear on expectations, questions & timeline review |
| 50% complete | Lead reviews for direction ("Are we solving the right problem?") |
| 90% complete | Lead reviews for polish ("Does this meet quality bar?") |
| 100% complete | Lead approval for client presentation ("Ready to ship?") |

Lead gives feedback using consistent framework:
- What's working well
- What needs revision (with specific examples)
- What's blocked/unclear
- Next steps

### Touch 3: Approval (Lead → Client)

**When:** Work is Lead-approved and ready for client
**How:** Lead decides format based on complexity

| Format | Use Case |
| :---- | :---- |
| Live meeting | Phase 1: Lead presents / Phase 2: Co-present / Phase 3: Associate presents |
| Loom recording | Quick updates or async clients |
| Slack message | Minor iterations |

**Lead does final quality check:**
- Does this solve the client's problem?
- Does this meet TDP quality standards?

**Associate preps files:**
- Organize Figma frames
- Add annotations if needed
