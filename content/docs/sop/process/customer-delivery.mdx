title: "Step 6: Customer Delivery"
description: Presenting work to customers through a gradual transition model
---

**Owner:** Lead (Associate participates as readiness increases)

## Gradual Transition Path

Live meeting delivery follows a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Observer (Months 1-2)
- Lead fully presents; Associate observes
- Lead presents everything to customer
- Associate watches and learns

### Phase 2: Co-Presenter (Months 3-5)
- Associate presents specific agenda items defined by the Lead
- Associate presents: "What we built" (execution)
- Lead presents: "Why we built it" (strategy)
- **Transition when:** Quality consistent, customer satisfaction >8/10

### Phase 3: Lead Presenter (Month 6+)
- Associate leads full customer delivery after sustained readiness, feedback cycles, and mentorship
- Associate owns entire customer presentation
- Lead reviews slides beforehand (async)
- Lead attends as advisor only

## Delivery Formats

| Format | Process |
| :---- | :---- |
| Live Meeting | Lead presents (Phase 1) OR Co-present (Phase 2) OR Associate presents (Phase 3) |
| Loom | Associate records with clear guidance from Lead. Lead reviews and ensures strategic alignment before sharing with customer |
| Async Figma | Comments with Lead's strategic context |

## Key Principles

- Lead presents all customer-facing work (calls and Looms) and remains **fully responsible** for the outcome
- Associate joins customer meetings to learn customer context and gradually present parts of the work when the Lead believes they are ready
- Lead makes the **final quality decisions** and approves all customer-facing work
- There is no separate handoff call — Associates join the Kickoff and strategic sessions as needed

## Transition & Handoff Period

During handoffs or transitions, Lead and Associate expect **2-3 weeks of "double work":**

- Both attend calls
- Associate works closely with the Lead on all designs
- Lead stays fully accountable while Associate learns the customer

**After the overlap:**
- Associate may take selected meetings alone (especially lower-risk/status sessions)
- Lead joins strategic discussions
