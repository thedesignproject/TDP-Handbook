title: "Customer & Designer Meeting Cadence"
description: Standard process for establishing ongoing communication with customers
---

**Owner:** Head of Design + Lead + Associate
**Timeline:** Setup after kickoff meeting

## Two Communication Options

### Option 1: Weekly Scheduled Meeting (Ideal/Recommended)

**Duration:** 1x 45 minutes OR 2x 30 minutes per week

**Setup Process:**
- Set up after kickoff meeting
- Send Slack message to customer with available time slots
- Both customer and designer agree on schedule
- Put recurring meeting on calendar

### Option 2: Office Hours

**Structure:**
- A dedicated weekly time block (e.g., 1 hour) held as a buffer
- Customer and designer coordinate when to use it
- Not mandatory to meet every week—just available when needed
- Customer messages designer when they need to hop on or just accept the invite for that day
- Must be added to designer's and customer's calendar (visible block like Mica's Wednesday office hours)

**Best for:** Customers who travel frequently, have unpredictable schedules, or keep canceling regular meetings

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** Async communication (Looms, Slack messages) happens regardless of which option is chosen. Office hours already covers async needs, so we don't list async as a separate option.
</Callout>

## Process Flow

### Step 1: Expectation Meeting (Head of Design with Customer)

- Ask customer preference: weekly meeting or office hours
- Record meeting (Granola recommended)
- Gather information about communication preferences

### Step 2: After Kickoff Meeting

- Send Slack message in channel confirming meeting setup
- Share available time slots for weekly meeting or office hours block
- Customer and designer finalize schedule

### Step 3: Calendar Setup

- Designer adds recurring meeting OR office hours block to calendar
- Ensure visibility for accountability

## Meeting Attendance

| Meeting Type | Lead | Associate |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Kickoff | Mandatory | Optional |
| Weekly/Office Hours (first few months) | Recommended | Required |
| Weekly/Office Hours (after relationship established) | Optional | Required |

<Callout type="warn">
Lead should be present at beginning of customer relationship to demonstrate maturity and guide associate. Step back once associate is ready to take ownership.
</Callout>

## Delivery & Async Communication

- Designers share deliverables via Loom in Slack channel
- Customers can also share Looms or request quick huddles

## Customers Currently Without Standard Recurring Meetings

| Customer | Designer | Reason | Recommendation |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Pure Spectrum | Luli | Doesn't require as much sync | Office Hours |
| Gam Payments | Leo | CEO always traveling, no time | Office Hours |
| Mesh | Delfi | Keeps canceling meetings | Office Hours |
