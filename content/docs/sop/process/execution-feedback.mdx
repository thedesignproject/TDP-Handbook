description: Daily and weekly execution rhythms for effective collaboration
---

**Owner:** Lead + Associate
**Timeline:** Ongoing

## Daily Cadence

### Associate: End-of-Day (EOD) Update

One update per customer, posted in the customer's internal channel on Slack:

- Work completed
- Design decisions made
- Questions or blockers
- Next day priorities

### Lead: Same-Day Feedback

- Same-day feedback on submissions when possible
- Otherwise morning-of feedback following the Associate's EOD update
- Schedules regular customer syncs (e.g., weekly meeting or office hours)
- Maintains alignment between customer expectations and internal work
- Organizes communication both with the customer and internally with the Associate
- Ensures feedback is shared promptly and tasks stay on-track

<Callout type="info">
**Daily Rhythm:** Associate sends an EOD update → Lead reviews and provides feedback/guidance first thing in the morning → Associate starts the day with clear direction.
</Callout>
