title: "Step 0: Before Kickoff"
description: Pre-kickoff preparation including capacity assessment and customer assignment
---

**Owner:** Design Manager + Lead

## Capacity Assessment

- Check Lead's capacity in the Lead Capacity Dashboard (Asana Portfolio), now visible to all Leads
- Confirm Associate availability
- Validate customer complexity fits model (no early-stage startups)

## Customer-Team Assignment

- Assess customer stage using the [compatibility matrix](/docs/sop#customer-compatibility-matrix)
- Assign an available Associate who is already paired with that Lead whenever possible. Each Associate should ideally have one consistent Lead, rather than working under multiple Leads
- Set realistic hour allocation expectations

## Operations Transition Plan

A simple written plan (Slack or short doc) that includes:

- Which meetings the Associate will join and starting when
- How long the overlap will last
- What part of the work Associate will take first
- What the Lead continues to own during the transition

<Callout type="info">
This plan is shared with Customer Success (Mica) so she can communicate clearly with the customer.

| Slack Channel | Create the customer Slack channel and add the Design Lead |
| Figma Project | Create the Figma project and ensure correct file structure |
| Introductions | Introduce the Design Lead to all customer assets, channels, and resources |
