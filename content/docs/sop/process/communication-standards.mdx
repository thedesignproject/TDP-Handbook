**Owner:** Designer (Lead or Associate depending on project phase)

## Communication Requirements

To ensure alignment and clarity for customers, designers must:

### Weekly Status Updates

**Timing:** First hours of Monday morning

**Content:**
- **Recap of the previous week** — What was completed, key decisions made
- **Current roadmap** — What's being worked on this week
- **Progress vs. plan** — Are we on track? Any blockers or delays?
- **Upcoming milestones and next steps** — What's coming up in the near future

### Meeting Scheduling

**After every call:**
- Share calendar availability to schedule next week's call
- Use recurring check-ins whenever possible
- Maintain predictable communication rhythm

## Rationale

Customers value **clarity and predictability**. Proactive status updates and structured check-ins:

- Reduce confusion and misalignment
- Improve trust and confidence in the partnership
- Prevent scope, timeline, and priority misunderstandings
- Create accountability and transparency

**Note:** These standards apply regardless of whether the customer has chosen weekly scheduled meetings or office hours (see [Meeting Cadence](/docs/sop/process/meeting-cadence)).
</Callout>

## Best Practices

- **Be proactive** — Don't wait for customers to ask for updates
- **Be consistent** — Send status updates at the same time each week
- **Be honest** — If there are delays or blockers, communicate them early
- **Be brief** — Keep updates concise and scannable
