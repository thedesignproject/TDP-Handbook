title: OOO Coverage Playbook
description: How Leads and Associates handle coverage when a Lead is out of office
---

When a Lead is OOO, the Associate owns the customer fully. This playbook defines responsibilities for both roles.

## Principle

When a Lead is OOO, the **Associate owns the customer fully** — execution, meetings, delivery, and decisions. No one reviews their work or tracks their progress. **Head of Design is available** via office hours or direct request if the Associate needs guidance, but she does not proactively oversee.

## Lead OOO Playbook

### Your Responsibility

When you're OOO, your Associate owns your customers fully. Your job is to **set them up for success before you leave** and **get back up to speed when you return**.

### Before You Leave (3-5 business days out)

| Task | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Write the handoff doc** | One per customer. Use the standard template below. |
| **Flag high-risk items** | Anything that could blow up — tell the Associate explicitly |
| **Resolve what you can** | Pending decisions, unclear scope, tense customer situations — handle before you go |
| **Brief your Associate** | "You own this fully. Head of Design's available if you need help. Here's what to watch for." |
| **Notify Head of Design** | Quick heads-up: "I'm out [dates], [Associate] has [customers], here's the handoff doc" |
| **Notify customers** | "[Your name] is OOO [dates]. [Associate] will be your point of contact." |

### Handoff Doc Template

Create one per customer:

```
## Customer: [Name]

### Active Projects
- [Project 1]: [Status, next milestone]
- [Project 2]: [Status, next milestone]

### Upcoming Deadlines During OOO
- [Date]: [What's due]

### Scheduled Meetings
- [Date/time]: [Meeting type, attendees]

### Pending Decisions / Open Threads
- [Decision needed]: [Context]

### Anything Tricky or Sensitive
- [E.g., "Customer was frustrated last week about timeline — tread carefully"]

### What to Defer Until I Return
- [E.g., "Don't commit to new scope," "Pricing discussion should wait"]
```

### When You Return (within 1-2 days)

| Task | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Sync with Associate** | 30 min per customer they covered. What happened? Any issues? Decisions made? |
| **Review what was delivered** | Catch up on customer threads, Figma files, any deliverables sent |
| **Resume ownership** | You're back in the driver's seat |
| **Thank your Associate** | They carried your customers — acknowledge it |

### OOO Duration Guidelines

| Duration | What's Required |
| :---- | :---- |
| **1-5 days** | Standard handoff |
| **6-14 days** | Standard handoff + customer notification required + flag high-risk items explicitly |
| **15+ days** | Requires coverage plan reviewed by Alex before approval |

### Company-Wide Holidays

For TDP-wide OOO days (Dec 24-25, Dec 31, Jan 1, etc.):
- No handoff needed
- Customers notified in advance by Ops
- Everyone is offline

## Associate OOO Coverage Playbook

### When Your Lead is OOO

**You own the customer fully.** Not "support" — own. You run the meetings, deliver the work, make the decisions, and communicate with the customer directly. No one is reviewing your work or checking on you.

This is your chance to prove you can carry it.

### Your Responsibilities

| Area | What You Do |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Customer meetings** | Run them solo. You're the point of contact. |
| **Design delivery** | Send work directly to customer. No review gate. |
| **Customer communication** | Slack, Loom, email — you handle it all |
| **Decisions** | Make day-to-day calls within existing scope |
| **Asking for help** | If you're stuck, seek help proactively. No one is coming to find you. |

### How to Get Help

Head of Design is available — but **you go to her**, she doesn't come to you.

| If you need... | Do this |
| :---- | :---- |
| Gut-check on a strategic question | Join Head of Design's office hours or message her directly |
| Help with a frustrated customer | Reach out to Head of Design |
| Design feedback | Ask a peer Associate or make the call yourself |
| Something is on fire | Tell Head of Design immediately → she escalates to Alex if needed |

<Callout type="warn">
Don't wait until it's a crisis. If something feels off, ask early.
</Callout>

### What to Defer (Don't Decide Alone)

Some things should wait for your Lead to return:

- Major strategic direction changes
- Pricing or contract conversations
- Committing to new projects or significant new scope
- Anything your Lead flagged as "wait for me"

If the customer pushes, say: *"[Lead] is back on [date] — let's confirm this with them then to make sure we're aligned."*

### Before Lead Leaves

| Your Job | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Review the handoff doc** | Read it carefully. Ask questions if anything is unclear. |
| **Know what's coming** | Meetings, deadlines, pending decisions — no surprises |
| **Confirm you're ready** | If something feels too risky to handle alone, say so NOW |
| **Know how to reach Head of Design** | Office hours schedule, direct message — know your options |

### During Lead's OOO

| Do This | Avoid This |
| :---- | :---- |
| Run meetings confidently — you're the point of contact | Apologizing for Lead being out or acting like a placeholder |
| Deliver work directly to customer | Waiting for someone to review before sending |
| Make decisions within scope | Committing to things outside your authority |
| Ask for help early if stuck | Sitting on a problem hoping it resolves itself |
| Keep customer informed and updated | Going silent or missing communication |

### When Lead Returns

| Your Job | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Sync with Lead** | 30 min: What happened, what you delivered, any issues, any open items |
| **Hand back ownership** | Lead is back in charge |
| **Share what you learned** | What went well? What was hard? Any feedback on the handoff? |

### Mindset

This is not babysitting. You're not "covering" — you're **owning**.

Your Lead trusted you with their customer. The customer is trusting you to deliver. Head of Design is there if you need backup, but the expectation is that you handle it.

<Callout type="info">
If you do this well, it's proof you're ready for more.
</Callout>

## Summary: Who Does What

| | Lead | Associate | Head of Design |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Before OOO** | Writes handoff, briefs Associate, notifies customer + Head of Design | Reviews handoff, asks questions, confirms readiness | Receives heads-up |
| **During OOO** | Offline | Owns everything, seeks help if needed | Available via office hours or DM |
| **After OOO** | Syncs with Associate, resumes ownership | Syncs with Lead, hands back | Nothing unless there was an escalation |
