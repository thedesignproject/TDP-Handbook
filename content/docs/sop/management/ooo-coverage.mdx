title: OOO Coverage Playbook
description: How Leads and Associates handle coverage when a Lead is out of office
---

When a Lead is OOO, coverage depends on the duration. This playbook defines a tiered approach based on how long the Lead will be away.

## Coverage Model

**Short OOO (1-5 working days):**
- Associate owns the customers fully — execution, meetings, delivery, and decisions
- Great learning opportunity with manageable risk
- Head of Design is available for support but doesn't proactively oversee

**Extended OOO (5+ working days):**
- Head of Design steps in as Lead replacement
- Head of Design becomes primary point of contact and decision-maker
- Associate continues execution under Head of Design's guidance
- Too long for Associate to manage alone without oversight

---

## Lead OOO Playbook

### Your Responsibility

Your job is to **set the right person up for success before you leave** and **get back up to speed when you return**.

- **1-5 days OOO:** Associate owns the customers fully
- **5+ days OOO:** Head of Design replaces you as Lead

---

## Short OOO (1-5 Working Days)

### Before You Leave (3-5 business days out)

| Task | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Write the handoff doc** | One per customer. Use the standard template below. |
| **Flag high-risk items** | Anything that could blow up — tell the Associate explicitly |
| **Resolve what you can** | Pending decisions, unclear scope, tense customer situations — handle before you go |
| **Brief your Associate** | "You own this fully. Head of Design's available if you need help. Here's what to watch for." |
| **Notify Head of Design** | Quick heads-up: "I'm out [dates], [Associate] has [customers], here's the handoff doc" |
| **Notify customers** | "[Your name] is OOO [dates]. [Associate] will be your point of contact." |

### Handoff Doc Template

Create one per customer:

```
## Customer: [Name]

### Active Projects
- [Project 1]: [Status, next milestone]
- [Project 2]: [Status, next milestone]

### Upcoming Deadlines During OOO
- [Date]: [What's due]

### Scheduled Meetings
- [Date/time]: [Meeting type, attendees]

### Pending Decisions / Open Threads
- [Decision needed]: [Context]

### Anything Tricky or Sensitive
- [E.g., "Customer was frustrated last week about timeline — tread carefully"]

### What to Defer Until I Return
- [E.g., "Don't commit to new scope," "Pricing discussion should wait"]
```

### When You Return (within 1-2 days)

| Task | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Sync with Associate** | 30 min per customer the Associate covered. What happened? Any issues? Decisions made? |
| **Review what was delivered** | Catch up on customer threads, Figma files, any deliverables sent |
| **Resume ownership** | You're back in the driver's seat |
| **Thank your Associate** | They carried the customers — acknowledge it |

---

## Extended OOO (5+ Working Days)

### Before You Leave (1-2 weeks out)

When you'll be gone for more than 5 working days, Head of Design steps in as your replacement. She needs comprehensive context to act as Lead.

| Task | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Write comprehensive handoff doc** | One per customer. Use extended template below. More detail than short OOO. |
| **Brief Head of Design (30-60 min)** | Walk through each customer, relationship dynamics, strategic context, what decisions are coming |
| **Introduce customers to Head of Design** | Email intro: "[Head of Design] will be acting as Lead while I'm out. She'll join our upcoming meetings and be your primary contact." |
| **Add Head of Design to all customer channels** | Slack workspaces, email threads, Figma files — full access |
| **Schedule Head of Design into upcoming meetings** | Transfer meeting ownership, brief her on meeting objectives |
| **Brief your Associate** | "Head of Design is stepping in as Lead. You'll work with her the same way you work with me." |
| **Resolve what you can** | Handle any pending decisions or tense situations before leaving |
| **Get Alex's approval** | For 15+ days OOO, coverage plan must be reviewed by Alex |

### Extended Handoff Doc Template

Create one per customer. More comprehensive than short OOO handoff:

```
## Customer: [Name]

### Relationship Context
- How long have we been working together?
- Customer's communication style and preferences
- Key stakeholders and their roles
- Any relationship sensitivities or history to know

### Active Projects
- [Project 1]: [Status, next milestone, strategic importance]
- [Project 2]: [Status, next milestone, strategic importance]

### Upcoming Deadlines During OOO
- [Date]: [What's due, level of risk]

### Scheduled Meetings
- [Date/time]: [Meeting type, attendees, agenda, what needs to be decided]

### Strategic Context
- Where is this customer in their product lifecycle?
- What are their current business priorities?
- How does our work tie to their goals?

### Pending Decisions / Open Threads
- [Decision needed]: [Context, options, your recommendation]

### Anything Tricky or Sensitive
- Recent frustrations or concerns
- Political dynamics to navigate
- What to tread carefully around

### Associate Context
- How is the Associate performing with this customer?
- Any skills they're working on?
- What level of guidance do they typically need?

### What to Defer Until I Return
- [E.g., "Don't commit to new scope," "Pricing discussion should wait"]
```

### Head of Design's Role During Extended OOO

When covering for 5+ days, Head of Design operates as the Lead:

- **Runs customer meetings** — Primary point of contact, sets agenda, drives decisions
- **Reviews Associate's work** — Provides feedback before customer delivery
- **Makes strategic decisions** — Within existing scope and customer agreements
- **Manages customer communication** — Slack, Loom, email
- **Guides Associate execution** — Same delegation and feedback model as Lead would use
- **Escalates to Alex if needed** — Major issues, scope changes, pricing discussions

### When You Return (within 2-3 days)

| Task | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Sync with Head of Design (60 min)** | Full download per customer. What happened? Decisions made? Issues? Customer sentiment? |
| **Sync with Associate (30 min per customer)** | Their perspective on what happened, how they felt working with Head of Design |
| **Review what was delivered** | Catch up on all customer threads, Figma files, deliverables |
| **Resume ownership** | Transition back from Head of Design to you |
| **Thank Head of Design & Associate** | They carried significant load — acknowledge it |

---

## OOO Duration Guidelines

| Duration | Coverage Model | What's Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **1-5 days** | Associate owns customers | Standard handoff to Associate + notify Head of Design |
| **5-14 days** | Head of Design replaces Lead | Extended handoff to Head of Design + customer introduction + Associate briefing |
| **15+ days** | Head of Design replaces Lead | Extended handoff + Alex approval required before OOO |

### Company-Wide Holidays

For TDP-wide OOO days (Dec 24-25, Dec 31, Jan 1, etc.):
- No handoff needed
- Customers notified in advance by Ops
- Everyone is offline

---

## Associate Playbook: Short OOO (1-5 Days)

### When Your Lead is OOO for 1-5 Days

**You own the customer fully.** Not "support" — own. You run the meetings, deliver the work, make the decisions, and communicate with the customer directly. No one is reviewing your work or checking on you.

This is your chance to prove you can carry it.

<Callout type="info">
For extended OOO (5+ days), Head of Design steps in as Lead. You'll work with her the same way you work with your Lead.
</Callout>

### Your Responsibilities

| Area | What You Do |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Customer meetings** | Run them solo. You're the point of contact. |
| **Design delivery** | Send work directly to customer. No review gate. |
| **Customer communication** | Slack, Loom, email — you handle it all |
| **Decisions** | Make day-to-day calls within existing scope |
| **Asking for help** | If you're stuck, seek help proactively. No one is coming to find you. |

### How to Get Help

Head of Design is available — but **you go to her**, she doesn't come to you.

| If you need... | Do this |
| :---- | :---- |
| Gut-check on a strategic question | Join Head of Design's office hours or message her directly |
| Help with a frustrated customer | Reach out to Head of Design |
| Design feedback | Ask a peer Associate or make the call yourself |
| Something is on fire | Tell Head of Design immediately → she escalates to Alex if needed |

<Callout type="warn">
Don't wait until it's a crisis. If something feels off, ask early.
</Callout>

### What to Defer (Don't Decide Alone)

Some things should wait for your Lead to return:

- Major strategic direction changes
- Pricing or contract conversations
- Committing to new projects or significant new scope
- Anything your Lead flagged as "wait for me"

If the customer pushes, say: *"[Lead] is back on [date] — let's confirm this with them then to make sure we're aligned."*

### Before Lead Leaves

| Your Job | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Review the handoff doc** | Read it carefully. Ask questions if anything is unclear. |
| **Know what's coming** | Meetings, deadlines, pending decisions — no surprises |
| **Confirm you're ready** | If something feels too risky to handle alone, say so NOW |
| **Know how to reach Head of Design** | Office hours schedule, direct message — know your options |

### During Lead's OOO

| Do This | Avoid This |
| :---- | :---- |
| Run meetings confidently — you're the point of contact | Apologizing for Lead being out or acting like a placeholder |
| Deliver work directly to customer | Waiting for someone to review before sending |
| Make decisions within scope | Committing to things outside your authority |
| Ask for help early if stuck | Sitting on a problem hoping it resolves itself |
| Keep customer informed and updated | Going silent or missing communication |

### When Lead Returns

| Your Job | Details |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Sync with Lead** | 30 min: What happened, what you delivered, any issues, any open items |
| **Hand back ownership** | Lead is back in charge |
| **Share what you learned** | What went well? What was hard? Any feedback on the handoff? |

### Mindset

This is not babysitting. You're not "covering" — you're **owning**.

Your Lead trusted you with the customer. The customer is trusting you to deliver. Head of Design is there if you need backup, but the expectation is that you handle it.

<Callout type="info">
If you do this well, it's proof you're ready for more.
</Callout>
