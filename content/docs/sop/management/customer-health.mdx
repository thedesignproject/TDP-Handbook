title: Customer Health & Churn Prevention
description: Proactive monitoring and intervention systems for customer relationship health
---

**Problem:** We learn about churn risk when it's too late. As we scale, we need proactive systems that surface customer health signals so we can act quickly if needed.

---

## Churn Indicators

### Onboarding

- Decreasing meeting attendance
- Expectations meeting feels forced
- Poor onboarding
- Unimpressive first deliverable
- No clear success metrics
- Customer asks to skip kickoff and rush through deliverables

### Company

- Recent funding changes
- Shift in priorities
- Company layoffs, organizational restructuring

### Engagement & Communication

- Response times getting longer over time
- Shorter, more transactional replies
- Stops asking questions or requesting context: just approves things passively
- CC's more people on emails
- Switches from sync to only async communication
- Customer started on a short commitment (monthly vs. quarterly vs. annual)
- Designer keeps following up with no response
- Customer constantly pushes meetings

### Scope & Value Perception

- Starts questioning costs or asking for itemized breakdowns they didn't ask for before
- Requests get smaller or less strategic (tactical tweaks vs. value projects)
- Stops involving designer in valuable conversations (strategy, roadmap)
- Mentions budget cuts, restructuring, or hiring in-house designers
- Asks for source files or asset handoffs outside normal cadence
- Not having roadmap visibility or understanding of product's bigger picture
- Customer stops mentioning future involvement ("next quarter", "when we scale")

### Relationship Quality

- Main POC leaves the company or changes roles
- New stakeholders enter who weren't part of onboarding
- Feedback becomes vague ("it's fine" vs. engaged critique)
- Stops sharing wins or celebrating launches together
- Tension around revisions that didn't exist before
- Not having a personal relationship with main POC

### Behavioral Patterns

- Payment delays or invoicing questions
- Contract renewal conversations keep getting pushed
- Comparing your work to other agencies or tools ("we saw X does this...")
- Has questions about partnership length

### Designer's Feeling

- Designer feels like they're "servicing" rather than "partnering"
- Work feels like it's on autopilot
- Customer sounds tired or distracted during calls
- Designer hesitates before pushing back on ideas
- Designer would not feel comfortable asking for a referral

## 1. Regular Touchpoint Cadence

### Design Lead Check-ins (Owner: Design Lead)

- Every Friday, Design Leads note any red flags in their customer relationships (see churn indicators)
- Fill out quick Slack update template: "Customer pulse: [Green/Yellow/Red] + 1-line reason"
- Captures ground-level signals before they escalate

### Weekly Account Reviews (Owner: Customer Success Lead)

- Sync in weekly operations meeting with Design Leads
- Review: engagement patterns, communication quality, scope alignment, relationship health
- Collect all ratings from Friday and review on Monday in a document

### Monthly Executive Check-ins (Owner: Customer Success Lead)

- Scheduled call with key stakeholder
- Understand how the partnership is working for them
- Ask explicitly about pain points, gaps, expectations vs reality
- Quick template with rating and one-liner added to document monthly:
  - Health Rating (1–5):
    - 1 = Critical risk · 3 = Neutral · 5 = Very healthy
  - One-liner Summary:
    - Single sentence capturing overall sentiment, alignment, and any major concern or win  
      (e.g., “Customer is happy with delivery pace but concerned about roadmap clarity post-Q2.”)
  - Key Risks / Follow-ups (if any):
    - Concrete risks, blockers, or required actions

## 2. Health Status Definitions

### Green: Healthy & Engaged

- Customer responds within their normal timeframe
- Customer participates actively in conversations
- Customer shares context about their work/roadmap
- Customer talks about future projects
- No churn indicators present

### Yellow: Watch Closely

**Criteria:** 2-3 churn indicators present OR noticeable pattern shift

**Action Required:**
- Document what you're seeing in Asana board
- Customer Success Lead schedules 1:1 with customer within 1 week
- Escalation point to founders (CEO) if needed

### Red: At Risk

**Criteria:** 4+ churn indicators OR critical flags (main POC leaving, payment delays, comparing to other agencies, contract renewal being pushed repeatedly)

**Action Required:**
- Immediate escalation to founders (CEO)
- Customer call scheduled within 48 hours
- Create retention plan or good exit strategy

## 3. Automation Support

### Teddy P Monitoring Critical Signals

No sentiment analysis, just catch the critical stuff while monitoring Slack channels.

#### Response Time Anomaly Detection

- Establishes baseline per customer (some are naturally slow)
- Always alert when anything is off
- Example: "Customer usually responds in 6 hours. Last 3 weeks averaging 2+ days."

#### Main POC Changes

- Flags when regular contact person goes quiet, or new names appear
- Example: "Sarah hasn't posted in 10 days. Tom (new) posting instead."

#### Meeting Pattern Changes

- Tracks when customers reschedule/skip meetings repeatedly
- 2+ rescheduled in a row: Alert

---

## 4. Payment & Contract Alerts (Accounting)

Simple automation:

- Invoice 7 days overdue → alert to Accounting lead + Sales lead
- Contract renewal in 30 days → alert to Customer Success Lead
- Plan finishing in 30 days → alert to Customer Success Lead

---

## 5. Intervention Playbooks

### When Designer Spots Yellow Flag:

1. Document it in tracker with specifics
2. Direct conversation with customer: "Hey [Name], I noticed [specific thing]. Is everything good on your end?"
3. Report in weekly account review with Founders
4. CS lead decides: Monitor or escalate to Founder?

### When Bot Flags Critical Keyword

1. Alert goes to designer + CS lead immediately
2. Within 24 hours: Review full conversation context
3. Within 48 hours: Customer Success Lead reaches out to customer
4. Document learnings, update health status

### When Multiple Churn Indicators Appear

1. Emergency huddle: Founders + CS Lead + Design Lead (same day)
2. Review: Full relationship history, what changed, what we missed
3. Decide: Intervention strategy
4. Act: Senior call (Head of Design or Founder) within 48 hours with clear objectives

---

## 6. Post-Churn Learning

When a customer leaves:

1. **Exit interview within 1 week** (founder or CS lead conducts)
2. **Ask:**
   - When did you start considering leaving?
   - What would've kept you?
   - What signals did we miss?
3. **Document findings** and share with team
4. **Update:** Churn indicators list if new patterns emerge
