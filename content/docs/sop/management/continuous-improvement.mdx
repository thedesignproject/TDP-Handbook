## Tracking with the Unified Dashboard

**Find it:** Asana → Portfolios → "Lead Capacity Dashboard"

### What You'll See

- All customer projects in one view
- Lead + Associate assigned
- Weekly meeting hours per customer
- Project phase + status

### Use It by Role

**Leads (Every Monday, 5 min):**
- Filter by your name
- Check: Over 1hr/week per customer?
- If yes → Flag to Alex + plan delegation

**HOD (Before assigning customers):**
- Check: Who has capacity?
- Target: fewer than 3 customers, under 1hr/week each
- Decision: Take customer or hire?

**Associates (Optional view):**
- Lead will tell you if priorities shift
- No active monitoring needed

<Callout type="info">
Stop making assignment decisions in Slack. Use the dashboard.

## Making Process Stick

Start with ONE process and make it sacred:

### Example: Design Reviews

| Element | Detail |
| :---- | :---- |
| **When** | Every Tuesday/Thursday 3-5pm |
| **What** | 30-min slots bookable by Associates |
| **How** | Use the same Figma template every time |
| **Track** | Simple spreadsheet — did it happen? Yes/No |

**After 2 weeks:**
- If 80%+ happened → add next process
- If under 80% → fix this one first

<Callout type="warn">
Stop creating new processes until the current one works.
