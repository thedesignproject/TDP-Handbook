## Escalation Process

### Level 1: Direct Resolution
**Who:** Lead addresses issue directly with Associate
**When:** First occurrence of warning signs
**Action:** Clear feedback and expectations

### Level 2: Documentation
**Who:** Lead documents issue and improvement plan
**When:** Issue persists after direct feedback
**Action:** Written improvement plan with specific milestones

### Level 3: Manager Involvement
**Who:** Design Manager joins weekly check-in
**When:** No improvement after documented plan
**Action:** Three-way discussion and revised timeline

### Level 4: Performance Plan
**Who:** Design Manager + HR
**When:** Continued underperformance
**Action:** Formal improvement/performance plan or role reassessment

<Callout type="warn">
Associates must proactively flag any inability to meet expectations **before deadlines** and propose a revised plan in Asana.
</Callout>

## Lead Time Management Issues

**Problem:** Leads still taking too many hours, limiting scalability.

**Solution:**

| Action | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Meeting limit | Strict 1-hour meeting limit per customer per week |
| Delegation checklist | Use the [delegation guide](/docs/sop/roles/lead#what-can-be-delegated-to-associates) |
| Time audits | Monthly track where Lead hours are going beyond meetings |
| Progressive handoffs | Gradually increase Associate autonomy |

### Transitioning Long-Term / Sensitive Customers

- Customer Success must communicate transitions early, especially for long-standing relationships
- Transition should not be rushed; customer communication can begin immediately, but the actual transition may happen later
- Expect **2-3 weeks of overlap** ("double work") where the Lead and Associate attend calls together and share design work
- Lead will temporarily exceed normal capacity during overlap; this is expected and communicated to the customer
- After the overlap, the Associate gradually takes over day-to-day calls while the Lead remains available for strategic guidance and escalations
