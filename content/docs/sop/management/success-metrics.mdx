## Customer Meeting Guidelines

<Callout type="info">
**Maximum meeting length: 45 minutes**

We avoid 1-hour customer meetings because they reduce available execution time and are rarely necessary for effective collaboration.
</Callout>

If the agenda is too long, the Lead is responsible for:
- Prioritizing discussion points
- Deferring non-essential topics
- Moving items to async (Slack, Loom, Figma comments)
- Scheduling follow-up only when strictly needed
