## Appendix: How to Complete This Review

### For Employees (Self-Assessment)
1. Complete Section 1 at least **5 business days** before review meeting
2. Be specific with examples and metrics—vague statements don't help you
3. Be honest in self-ratings; over-inflation undermines the process

### For Managers

**Leadership Principles Ratings:**
- **Role Model (RM):** Exemplary; others should learn from this person. Limit to ~5% of your team per principle.
- **Demonstrates (D):** Consistently shows this principle in their work.
- **Developing (DV):** Inconsistent or needs growth in this area.

**Stack Ranking Process:**
1. Score all direct reports on Performance, Potential, and LPs
2. Calculate OV scores
3. Force-rank into tiers according to distribution targets
4. Document clear justification for each placement
5. Calibrate with peer managers before finalizing

**Forced Distribution Note:**
For teams with 10+ employees, adhere to distribution targets. Smaller teams may flex slightly but should trend toward targets over multiple quarters.
