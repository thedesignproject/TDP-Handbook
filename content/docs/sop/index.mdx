title: Lead & Associate Model Overview
description: A standardized operating procedure for pairing senior and junior designers to scale customer impact
---

The Lead & Associate model pairs senior designers (Leads) with junior designers (Associates) to scale customer impact while accelerating junior designer growth. Leads own customer relationships and strategy; Associates focus on execution under mentorship.

## Scalability

This process is designed to work with **ANY designer**, regardless of personality, background, or working style. Success will come from following standardized procedures, not individual talent or characteristics.

### Core Principles

- **One size fits all:** Same process works for every Associate
- **Repeatable systems:** Identical templates, tools, and communication protocols
- **Clear standards:** Same quality expectations and timelines for everyone
- **Measurable outcomes:** Universal success metrics that anyone can achieve

If a designer can follow instructions and meet deadlines, they can succeed as an Associate.

## Customer Compatibility Matrix

| Customer Type | Model Fit | Reasoning | Alternative |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Early Stage (0-1 products) | Not Compatible | Requires speed + deep UX complexity that prevents effective delegation | Solo Senior Designer |
| Growth Stage | Ideal | Balanced strategic + execution needs | Standard Process |
| Established Product | Good | Clear execution focus with minimal UX complexity | Standard Process |
| Branding/Marketing | Excellent | Highly scalable with clear deliverables | Standard Process |

<Callout type="warn">
Early-stage startups break this model due to speed requirements and UX complexity that prevents effective delegation.
</Callout>

### Other Cases to Consider

- Complex Market Products requiring extensive domain knowledge
- Research/Strategy Heavy Projects where work is primarily discovery vs. execution
- Single-Sprint Projects too short for effective Lead + Associate coordination

## Universal Associate Requirements

ANY designer who successfully makes it through our recruiting process can succeed as an Associate by following these standardized requirements:

- Follow the exact same process regardless of personality or background
- Execute the same communication protocols and deliverables
- Meet the same quality and timeline standards
- Complete the same learning and growth activities
