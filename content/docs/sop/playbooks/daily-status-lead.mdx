## Your Role as Lead

As a Lead, you're responsible for:
- Providing clear direction and context
- Responding to Associate daily updates promptly
- Managing task assignments and deadlines
- Spotting patterns early and escalating when needed

This guide shows you exactly how to do each of these.

---

## Quick Reference

| Your Responsibility | When | Where |
|---------------------|------|-------|
| Morning context (if priorities changed) | First hour of Associate's day | #internal-[customer] |
| Response to Associate status | Within 2 hours OR by next morning | Same thread |
| Hold Office Hours slots | Weekly — 2-3 bookable 30-min slots | Cal.designproject.io |
| Verify Asana task hygiene | Weekly | Asana |

---

## 1. Timezone Alignment

Before starting work with an Associate, document working hours in the Asana Project Overview.

### What to Document

| Setting | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Associate working hours | 9am - 6pm ART |
| Lead working hours | 9am - 6pm ART |
| Overlap window (real-time availability) | 10am - 4pm ART |

### Time References

- **"Morning"** = First hour of Associate's workday (their timezone)
- **"EOD"** = End of Associate's workday, 5-6pm (their timezone)
- **"Next morning"** = Start of Associate's next workday

---

## 2. Morning Context (You → Associate)

**When:** First hour of Associate's workday
**Required:** Only when priorities changed overnight

### When to Post

Post in customer internal channel when:
- Customer priority shifted
- Feedback came in that changes direction
- Urgent redirect needed before Associate starts

### When to Skip

- Associate is on track
- No changes from yesterday's sync

### Format

Use this template:

```
Quick heads up — [brief context on what changed].

Today, please prioritize [X] instead of [Y].

Reason: [1 sentence why]

Questions? Reply here or book Office Hours.
```

**Example:**
> Quick heads up — Customer wants to focus on mobile-first for the landing page.
>
> Today, please prioritize mobile designs instead of desktop.
>
> Reason: They're presenting to investors next week and most traffic is mobile.
>
> Questions? Reply here or book Office Hours.

## 3. Responding to Daily Status Updates

**When:** Within 2 hours of Associate's EOD update, OR by Associate's next morning start — whichever is first
**Where:** Reply in the same thread (not a new message)
**Required:** Every update must get a response

### Response Format

| Response | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| 👍 Proceed as planned | Work is on track, no changes | "👍 Looks good, keep going" |
| ⚠️ Before tomorrow: [redirect] | Priority shift or direction change | "⚠️ Before tomorrow: pause mobile, customer wants to review desktop first" |
| 🔴 Let's sync — pinging you | Complex issue needing real-time discussion | "🔴 Let's sync on the checkout question — pinging you for Office Hours" |

**Target:** 90% of responses should be quick (👍 or 1-2 sentences).

### Understanding Associate Status Indicators

| Status | Meaning | You Should... |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| ✅ On track | Work proceeding as planned | Quick acknowledgment |
| ⚠️ Need input | Question or decision needed, not urgent | Respond with direction |
| 🔴 Blocked | Cannot proceed without help | Prioritize response or schedule sync |

---

## 4. Channel Usage Rules

All work discussions stay in customer channels. This creates searchable history and shared context.

### Redirecting Work Questions from DMs

**If an Associate DMs you a work question:**

1. Copy/forward the Associate's message to #internal-[customer]
2. Reply in the channel (not the DM)
3. Brief note to Associate: "Answered in the channel 👆"

**Why this approach:** Less friction than asking them to re-post. You model the correct behavior while keeping the conversation documented. The Associate sees where the answer lives.

**Enforce consistently for 2-3 weeks** until the habit forms. Never answer work questions in DMs — it reinforces the wrong behavior and creates knowledge silos.

### Channel Guidelines

| Channel | Use For | NOT For |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **#internal-[customer]** | Daily sync, work feedback, design direction, all work discussions | — |
| **Office Hours** | Real-time blockers, complex design reviews, quick alignment syncs | Status updates, async questions |
| **DMs with Associate** | Personal/sensitive topics, performance conversations | Work questions, design feedback, project discussions |

---

## 5. Office Hours Management

### Your Responsibilities

| Element | Your Role |
|---------|-----------|
| **Hold slots** | Keep 2-3 bookable 30-min slots per week |
| **Booking link** | Share your cal.designproject.io link |
| **Monitor usage** | Track if Associates are booking appropriately |

### Expected Associate Booking Patterns

| Associate Phase | Expected Usage | Your Action If... |
|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Months 1-2** | Minimum 2x/week | No bookings = check in (red flag) |
| **Months 3-5** | 0-2x/week typical | — |
| **Month 6+** | 0-1x/week typical | Excessive bookings = check autonomy |

**If a new Associate (months 1-2) isn't booking Office Hours:**
- This is a red flag
- Check in directly: "I noticed you haven't booked Office Hours this week. What questions can I help with?"
- They may not know it's expected, or they may be stuck and hiding it

## 6. Asana Task Management

Before any work begins, ensure tasks are properly set up.

### Required Fields for Every Task

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Assigned to** | Associate who owns the work | @Associate Name |
| **Internal deadline** | When Associate should complete | Wed 5pm |
| **Lead review deadline** | When you will review | Thu 12pm |
| **Customer deadline** | When customer sees it | Fri 2pm |

### Deadline Structure

```
Associate completes → You review → Customer sees
     (buffer)           (buffer)
```

**Example timeline:**
- Associate deadline: Wednesday 5pm
- Lead review deadline: Thursday 12pm (you block time)
- Customer presentation: Friday 2pm

### Weekly Task Hygiene Checklist

Check weekly:
- [ ] All active tasks have an assigned Associate
- [ ] All tasks have internal deadline (Associate completes)
- [ ] All tasks have Lead review deadline
- [ ] All tasks have customer deadline (if applicable)
- [ ] No tasks sitting in "In Progress" longer than expected
- [ ] Blocked tasks are flagged and addressed

## 7. Edge Cases & Escalation

### Edge Case 1: Repeated Low/No Output

When Associate posts low or no progress for multiple consecutive days:

| Days | Signal | Your Action |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **1 day** | Normal variance | Acknowledge, no action needed |
| **2 days** | Worth noting | Check in via thread: "Seeing a couple slower days — anything I can help unblock?" |
| **3 days** | Pattern forming | Book Office Hours or sync: "Let's talk through what's going on and how I can help." |
| **5+ days** | Performance concern | Escalate to Design Manager. Document pattern. Begin formal conversation. |

#### Response Templates

**Day 2 — Gentle check-in (in-thread):**
> Noticing a couple lighter days — is something blocking you, or do you need more work assigned? Let me know how I can help.

**Day 3 — Direct conversation (Office Hours):**
> Hey, I want to check in. I've seen a few days without much progress posted. No judgment — I just want to understand what's happening so we can fix it together. Is it:
> - Waiting on something from me or the customer?
> - Unclear on priorities or next steps?
> - Something personal going on?
> - Workload issue (too much or too little)?
>
> Let's figure it out.

**Day 5+ — Escalation to Design Manager:**

Document and share:
- Dates and what was posted
- Any context Associate provided
- What you tried (check-ins, Office Hours)
- Your assessment of root cause

**The goal is support, not punishment.** Most repeated low output has a fixable cause — unclear tasks, personal issues, skill gaps, or workload mismatch. Surface it early, address it directly.

---

### Edge Case 2: Associate Stops Posting Daily Sync

| Missed Days | Your Action |
|-------------|-------------|
| **1 day** | DM: "Hey, didn't see your EOD update — everything okay?" |
| **2 days** | DM + mention in channel: "Checking in — please post your status update today." |
| **3+ days** | Escalate to Design Manager immediately. This is a reliability issue requiring formal conversation. |

**Missing daily syncs is not acceptable.** Even "nothing to report" requires a post. Repeated no-shows without explanation should be escalated quickly.

---

## 8. Weekly Rhythm

| Time | Your Responsibilities |
|------|----------------------|
| **Morning (Associate's TZ)** | Post morning context if priorities changed |
| **During day** | Available during Office Hours slots |
| **Within 2hrs of EOD or by next morning** | Respond in-thread to all daily syncs |
| **Weekly** | Hold 2-3 Office Hour slots, verify Asana task hygiene |

---
