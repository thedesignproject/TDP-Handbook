## Overview: How It Works

### 1. Timezone Alignment

Before starting work together, Lead and Associate document working hours in Asana Project Overview:
- Associate working hours
- Lead working hours
- Overlap window for real-time availability

### 2. Daily Cadence

**Morning (Optional):**
- Lead posts context if priorities changed overnight
- Associate checks channel before starting work

**End of Day (Required):**
- Associate posts status update with: what they did, current status (✅⚠️🔴), links, feedback needed, tomorrow's plan
- Lead responds within 2 hours or by next morning

### 3. Office Hours

- Lead holds 2-3 bookable 30-min slots per week
- Associate books via cal.designproject.io when blocked or needs real-time discussion
- Expected usage: 2x/week minimum for months 1-2, decreasing as autonomy increases

### 4. Channel Usage

**All work discussions happen in customer channels (#internal-[customer]):**
- Daily status updates
- Work questions
- Design feedback
- Loom reviews

**DMs are only for personal/sensitive topics.**
