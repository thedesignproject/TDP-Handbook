title: Daily Status Playbook
description: How Leads and Associates communicate daily for clear visibility and fast feedback
---

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** December 2024

---

## Purpose

This playbook defines how Leads and Associates communicate daily. The goal is simple: **clear visibility, fast feedback, no surprises.**

Every Associate knows what's expected. Every Lead knows how to respond. Everyone knows where communication happens.

---

## Quick Reference

| Who | What | When | Where |
|-----|------|------|-------|
| Lead | Morning context (if priorities changed) | First hour of Associate's day | #internal-[customer] |
| Associate | Daily status update | End of workday (5-6pm their TZ) | #internal-[customer] |
| Lead | Response to status | Within 2 hours OR by next morning | Same thread |
| Either | Real-time sync if blocked | As needed | Office Hours |

---

## 1. Timezone Alignment

Before starting work together, Lead and Associate must align on working hours.

### What to Document (in Asana Project Overview)

| Setting | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Associate working hours | 9am - 6pm ART |
| Lead working hours | 9am - 6pm ART |
| Overlap window (real-time availability) | 10am - 4pm ART |

### Time References in This Playbook

- **"Morning"** = First hour of Associate's workday (their timezone)
- **"EOD"** = End of Associate's workday, 5-6pm (their timezone)
- **"Next morning"** = Start of Associate's next workday

---

## 2. Daily Cadence

### Step 1: Morning Context (Lead → Associate)

**When:** First hour of Associate's workday
**Required:** Only when priorities changed overnight

Post in customer internal channel when:
- Customer priority shifted
- Feedback came in that changes direction
- Urgent redirect needed before Associate starts

**Skip when:**
- Associate is on track
- No changes from yesterday's sync

**Format:**
> Quick heads up — [Customer] needs us to prioritize [X] today instead of [Y]. Context: [brief reason]. Let me know if questions.

---

### Step 2: Daily Status Update (Associate → Lead)

**When:** End of Associate's workday (5-6pm their timezone)
**Required:** Every day, one update per customer
**Where:** Customer internal Slack channel via Daily Status bot

#### Status Update Fields

| Field | Required | What to Include |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **What I did today** | Yes | Work completed, progress made |
| **Status** | Yes | ✅ On track \| ⚠️ Need input \| 🔴 Blocked |
| **Links** | Optional | Figma frames, Loom recordings |
| **Feedback needed** | Optional | Specific question + Loom link |
| **Tomorrow I plan** | Yes | Next day priorities |

#### Status Definitions

| Status | Meaning | Lead Should... |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| ✅ On track | Work proceeding as planned | Quick acknowledgment |
| ⚠️ Need input | Question or decision needed, not urgent | Respond with direction |
| 🔴 Blocked | Cannot proceed without help | Prioritize response or schedule sync |

#### Example Update

> **What I did today:** Completed wireframes for checkout flow (v1). Started mobile responsive layouts.
>
> **Status:** ⚠️ Need input
>
> **Links:** [Figma link]
>
> **Feedback needed:** Should we keep the guest checkout option or require account creation? Loom walkthrough: [link]
>
> **Tomorrow I plan:** Finish mobile layouts, start hi-fi if direction confirmed.

---

### Step 3: Lead Response (Lead → Associate)

**When:** Within 2 hours of Associate's EOD update, OR by Associate's next morning start — whichever is first
**Where:** Reply in the same thread (not a new message)
**Required:** Every update must get a response

#### Response Format

| Response | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| 👍 Proceed as planned | Work is on track, no changes | "👍 Looks good, keep going" |
| ⚠️ Before tomorrow: [redirect] | Priority shift or direction change | "⚠️ Before tomorrow: pause mobile, customer wants to review desktop first" |
| 🔴 Let's sync — pinging you | Complex issue needing real-time discussion | "🔴 Let's sync on the checkout question — pinging you for Office Hours" |

**Target:** 90% of responses should be quick (👍 or 1-2 sentences).

---

## 3. Channel Usage Rules

All work discussions stay in customer channels. This creates searchable history and shared context.

### Where to Communicate

| Channel | Use For | NOT For |
|---------|---------|---------|
| **#internal-[customer]** | Daily sync, work feedback, design direction, Loom reviews, project questions, morning context | — |
| **Office Hours** | Blockers needing real-time conversation, complex design reviews, quick alignment syncs | Status updates, async questions |
| **DMs with Lead** | Personal/sensitive topics, performance conversations, "can we talk?" pings | Work questions, design feedback, project discussions |

### Redirecting Work Questions from DMs

If an Associate DMs a work question, Lead should **forward the message** to the customer channel and reply there:

1. Copy/forward the Associate's message to #internal-[customer]
2. Reply in the channel (not the DM)
3. Brief note to Associate: "Answered in the channel 👆"

**Why this approach:** Less friction than asking them to re-post. You model the correct behavior while keeping the conversation documented. The Associate sees where the answer lives.

**Enforce consistently for 2-3 weeks** until the habit forms. Never answer work questions in DMs — it reinforces the wrong behavior and creates knowledge silos.

---

## 4. Office Hours

Office Hours replace ad-hoc 1-1s for tactical work discussions.

### Structure

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| **Owner** | Lead holds time, Associate books |
| **Frequency** | Weekly — Lead holds 2-3 bookable 30-min slots |
| **Booking** | Via Lead's Cal.com link |
| **Purpose** | Blockers, complex questions, design review discussions, quick alignment |

### Usage by Associate Phase

| Phase | Expected Usage | Lead Expectation |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| **Months 1-2** | Minimum 2x/week | If Associate isn't booking, check in — no bookings is a red flag |
| **Months 3-5** | As needed | 0-2x/week is typical |
| **Month 6+** | As needed | Should decrease as autonomy increases, 0-1x/week typical |

### When to Book Office Hours

**Book when:**
- Blocked and need real-time problem-solving
- Design decision requires discussion (not just async feedback)
- Need to walk through something complex together
- Customer situation needs alignment

**Don't book when:**
- Question can be answered in daily sync thread
- Just need approval (use async Loom + thread)
- Status update (use daily sync)

---

## 5. Asana Task Requirements

Before any work begins, Lead must ensure tasks are properly set up.

### Required Fields for Every Task

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Assigned to** | Associate who owns the work | @Associate Name |
| **Internal deadline** | When Associate should complete | Wed 5pm |
| **Lead review deadline** | When Lead will review | Thu 12pm |
| **Customer deadline** | When customer sees it | Fri 2pm |

### Deadline Structure

```
Associate completes → Lead reviews → Customer sees
     (buffer)            (buffer)
```

**Example timeline:**
- Associate deadline: Wednesday 5pm
- Lead review deadline: Thursday 12pm (Lead blocks time)
- Customer presentation: Friday 2pm

### Lead Weekly Task Hygiene

Check weekly:
- [ ] All active tasks have an assigned Associate
- [ ] All tasks have internal deadline (Associate completes)
- [ ] All tasks have Lead review deadline
- [ ] All tasks have customer deadline (if applicable)
- [ ] No tasks sitting in "In Progress" longer than expected
- [ ] Blocked tasks are flagged and addressed

---

## 6. Edge Cases

### Edge Case 1: Associate Has Nothing to Report

**Rule: Always post. Never skip the daily sync.**

Even on slow days, the status update provides visibility. "Nothing to report" without context is not acceptable.

| Scenario | Example Status Update |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Blocked / waiting** | "What I did: Waiting on [X] to unblock the dashboard work. Reviewed competitor patterns while blocked. Status: 🔴 Blocked. Tomorrow: Resume dashboard once unblocked." |
| **Light workload** | "What I did: Wrapped up minor fixes from yesterday. No new tasks assigned. Status: ⚠️ Need input — ready for next assignment. Tomorrow: [pending direction]" |
| **Sick / partial day** | "What I did: Out sick this morning, back half-day. Made progress on [X]. Status: ✅ On track (adjusted). Tomorrow: Continue [X]." |
| **Slow day** | "What I did: Slower day — worked on [X] but didn't finish. Status: ⚠️ Need input — may need to adjust timeline. Tomorrow: Finish [X], start [Y]." |

**Why this matters:**
- Lead can't help if they don't know there's a problem
- Patterns become visible early (before they're crises)
- Associates practice owning their situation, not hiding from it

---

### Edge Case 2: Repeated Low/No Output — Lead Escalation

When Associate posts low or no progress for multiple consecutive days:

| Days | Signal | Lead Action |
|------|--------|-------------|
| **1 day** | Normal variance | Acknowledge, no action needed |
| **2 days** | Worth noting | Check in via thread: "Seeing a couple slower days — anything I can help unblock?" |
| **3 days** | Pattern forming | Book Office Hours or sync: "Let's talk through what's going on and how I can help." |
| **5+ days** | Performance concern | Escalate to Design Manager. Document pattern. Begin formal conversation. |

#### Response Templates

**Day 2 — Gentle check-in (in-thread):**
> Noticing a couple lighter days — is something blocking you, or do you need more work assigned? Let me know how I can help.

**Day 3 — Direct conversation (Office Hours):**
> Hey, I want to check in. I've seen a few days without much progress posted. No judgment — I just want to understand what's happening so we can fix it together. Is it:
> - Waiting on something from me or the customer?
> - Unclear on priorities or next steps?
> - Something personal going on?
> - Workload issue (too much or too little)?
>
> Let's figure it out.

**Day 5+ — Escalation to Design Manager:**

Document and share:
- Dates and what was posted
- Any context Associate provided
- What you tried (check-ins, Office Hours)
- Your assessment of root cause

**The goal is support, not punishment.** Most repeated low output has a fixable cause — unclear tasks, personal issues, skill gaps, or workload mismatch. Surface it early, address it directly.

---

### Edge Case 3: Associate Stops Posting Daily Sync Entirely

| Missed Days | Lead Action |
|-------------|-------------|
| **1 day** | DM: "Hey, didn't see your EOD update — everything okay?" |
| **2 days** | DM + mention in channel: "Checking in — please post your status update today." |
| **3+ days** | Escalate to Design Manager immediately. This is a reliability issue requiring formal conversation. |

**Missing daily syncs is not acceptable.** Even "nothing to report" requires a post. Repeated no-shows without explanation should be escalated quickly.

## 7. Weekly Rhythm Summary

| Time | Associate | Lead |
|------|-----------|------|
| **Morning (Associate's TZ)** | Check for Lead's morning context, start work | Post morning context if priorities changed |
| **During day** | Execute work, book Office Hours if blocked | Available during Office Hours slots |
| **EOD (Associate's TZ)** | Post daily sync (each customer) | — |
| **Within 2hrs of EOD or by next morning** | — | Respond in-thread to all daily syncs |
| **Weekly** | Book Office Hours as needed (2x min for months 1-2) | Hold 2-3 Office Hour slots, verify Asana task hygiene |

---

---

## 9. Associate Checklist

### Daily
- [ ] Checked customer channel for Lead's morning context
- [ ] Posted EOD status update (one per customer) before end of workday
- [ ] Used correct Status indicator (✅ / ⚠️ / 🔴)
- [ ] Included specific question if feedback needed (not just "let me know what you think")

## Appendix: Templates

### Daily Status Update Template

```
**What I did today:**
[Describe work completed and progress made]

**Status:** [✅ On track | ⚠️ Need input | 🔴 Blocked]

**Links:** [Optional - Figma, Loom, etc.]

**Feedback needed:** [Optional - Specific question + context/Loom]

**Tomorrow I plan:**
[Next day priorities]
```

### Morning Context Template (Lead)

```
Quick heads up — [brief context on what changed].

Today, please prioritize [X] instead of [Y].

Reason: [1 sentence why]

Questions? Reply here or book Office Hours.
```

### Feedback Request Best Practice

**Instead of:**
> "Let me know what you think" + Loom link

**Use:**
> "Should I go with the tab navigation or sidebar approach? Context in this Loom: [link]"

Specific questions get faster, more useful responses.
