**What:** Share calendar link to schedule next week's call

**Purpose:** Maintain momentum and prevent scheduling gaps

## Rationale

Customers value clarity and predictability. Proactive communication:

- **Reduces confusion** — Clear status prevents misalignment on scope and timelines

- **Prevents misalignment** — Regular touchpoints catch issues early
- **Sets expectations** — Transparent progress reporting builds confidence
