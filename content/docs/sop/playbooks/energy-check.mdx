title: Weekly Energy Check Playbook
description: How team members share their energy levels and workload to help Leads sense burnout early
---

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Purpose

This playbook defines how team members regularly share their energy levels, workload, and morale with their Leads. The goal is simple: **sense burnout early, give everyone a voice, and create space for support without pressure.**

Every team member has a weekly opportunity to be heard. Every Lead has early warning signals. Everyone benefits from a culture that prioritizes wellbeing.

## Quick Reference

| What | When | Where | Who Sees It | Mandatory? |
|------|------|-------|-------------|------------|
| Energy Check message | Every Friday | Direct message to Lead/Manager | Only the Lead | Optional (but encouraged) |
| Lead reminder (if 2 weeks no submission) | After 2 weeks of silence | DM to team member | N/A | N/A |
| Lead 1-on-1 check-in | After 2 consecutive reds | Scheduled sync | Team member + Lead | N/A |
| Escalation to DesignOps | After 3 consecutive reds | Lead → DesignOps | Lead + DesignOps + team member | N/A |

---

## Overview: How It Works

### 1. Who Participates

**All team members** (Associates, Leads, Managers) share their weekly energy check with their direct reporting Lead or Manager.

**New team members** begin participating **1 month after joining** to allow for settling-in period.

### 2. Weekly Rhythm

**Every Friday:**
- Team member sends energy check message directly to their Lead/Manager
- No response expected from Lead (unless patterns trigger follow-up)
- Lead monitors patterns and takes action when needed

**This is optional but encouraged.** It's a gift to yourself and your Lead—a chance to be seen and supported.

### 3. Privacy & Visibility

- Messages go directly to the individual's Lead (via DM)
- Only the Lead sees the individual response
- Information is **not required to be confidential**—Leads may share trends with DesignOps or leadership if needed for support

## What to Share: The Four Metrics

Every energy check should include these four elements:

### 1. Traffic Light: Energy Level
🟢 **Green - Energized:** Feeling good, motivated, ready to tackle challenges
🟡 **Yellow - Neutral:** Steady state, managing fine, neither high nor low
🔴 **Red - Drained:** Exhausted, struggling, running on empty

### 2. Workload Status
**Overloaded:** Too much on my plate, struggling to keep up
**Balanced:** Just right, manageable pace
**Underutilized:** Could take on more, looking for opportunities

### 3. Morale
How are you feeling about your work, team, and role overall?
*(Can be a simple rating like High/Medium/Low or a brief phrase)*

### 4. Open-Ended Feedback
1-2 lines of context, observations, or anything you want your Lead to know.
*(This is where you can explain the "why" behind your metrics)*

---

## Message Template (Optional Guide)

**You don't need to follow this exactly—just include the four metrics above.**

```
Weekly Energy Check - [Date]

Energy: 🟢 / 🟡 / 🔴
Workload: Overloaded / Balanced / Underutilized
Morale: [High/Medium/Low or brief description]

Feedback: [1-2 lines about your week, context, or anything notable]
```

**Example:**
```
Weekly Energy Check - Jan 10

Energy: 🟡
Workload: Balanced
Morale: Medium

Feedback: Had a productive week on the redesign project, but feeling a bit stuck on the navigation challenge. Looking forward to discussing it in Office Hours.
```

## What Leads Should Do

### Monitor, Don't React (Usually)

**Default stance:** Leads receive energy checks and monitor patterns. No immediate response required.

**The energy check is about giving team members a voice, not creating extra communication burden.**

### When to Take Action

| Pattern | Action | Timeline |
|---------|--------|----------|
| **2 consecutive reds** | Schedule a 1-on-1 check-in | Within 1 week |
| **3 consecutive reds** | Escalate to DesignOps for additional support | Immediately |
| **2 weeks of no submission** | Send a gentle reminder | End of 2nd week |
| **Consistent "overloaded" reports** | Review workload distribution, consider rebalancing | Within 2 weeks |

### Types of Support to Consider

When patterns emerge, Leads can offer:
- **1-on-1 check-in:** Dedicated time to talk through what's happening
- **Workload rebalancing:** Redistribute tasks, adjust deadlines, or pause non-critical work
- **Encourage time off:** Suggest taking a day or half-day to recharge
- **Escalate to DesignOps:** Bring in additional resources or support systems
- **Resource sharing:** Point to mental health resources, wellness programs, or company benefits

**The goal is support, not surveillance.**

## What Makes This Work

### For Team Members:
- Regular opportunity to be heard without scheduling a meeting
- Low-pressure way to signal when things aren't okay
- Patterns are tracked so nothing falls through the cracks
- Leads are empowered to help before burnout becomes critical
- Optional nature means you share when you need to, not because you have to

### For Leads:
- Early warning system for burnout and morale issues
- Data points to spot patterns over time
- Clear action triggers so you know when to intervene
- Documented history helps with context
- Ability to support proactively rather than reactively

### For The Organization:
- Culture of wellbeing and psychological safety
- Reduced burnout and turnover
- Healthier, more sustainable work environment
- Trust between team members and leadership
- Actionable data on team health

## Edge Cases & Flexibility

### What if someone shares 3 reds but says "I'm fine, no action needed"?

Respect their agency, but still schedule a check-in. Sometimes people downplay their struggles. A conversation can clarify whether support is truly not needed or whether they're hesitant to ask.

### What if someone never submits energy checks?

That's their choice—it's optional. However, if you notice this coincides with other signs of disengagement or struggle, consider a broader check-in about how they're doing overall.

### What if a Lead sees concerning patterns but the person doesn't want help?

Document your concern and the offer of support. Escalate to DesignOps if the pattern persists or worsens. Respect boundaries while maintaining duty of care.

### What if workload is consistently "overloaded" across the team?

This is a systemic issue, not an individual one. Leads should escalate to DesignOps and leadership to address resource allocation, hiring, or scope management.

### Can team members share energy checks more than once a week?

Absolutely. If something urgent comes up mid-week, team members should feel empowered to reach out. The Friday rhythm is a baseline, not a limitation.

---

## Confidentiality & Data Use

While energy checks go directly to Leads and are not public, **this information is not required to be confidential.**

Leads may:
- Share aggregated trends with DesignOps or leadership (e.g., "Several team members reporting high workload")
- Discuss specific cases with DesignOps when escalating for support
- Reference patterns in performance conversations if relevant to support planning

Leads should **not**:
- Share individual energy checks publicly or with peers
- Use energy check data punitively
- Pressure team members to justify their feelings

**The purpose is support, not surveillance.**

## Getting Started

### For Team Members:
1. Mark "Energy Check" as a recurring reminder every Friday
2. Take 2 minutes to reflect on your week
3. Send your check-in directly to your Lead
4. That's it—no response expected unless you specifically ask for one

### For Leads:
1. Let your team know this practice is starting and why it matters
2. Clarify that it's optional and no response is expected from you by default
3. Create a system to track patterns (spreadsheet, notes, etc.)
4. Follow the action triggers when patterns emerge

### For New Team Members:
- Begin participating **1 month after your Date of Joining**
- Your Lead will remind you when it's time to start
- Use the first few weeks to observe the rhythm and culture
