title: Fortnightly Knowledge Sharing Playbook
description: How Associates present their learning and design mindset evolution to the design team
---

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## Purpose

This playbook defines how Associates share their growth and learning with the design team every two weeks. The goal is simple: **validate learning curves, demonstrate design mindset evolution, and build a culture of continuous improvement.**

Every Associate gets a platform to showcase their thinking. Every team member learns from real project experiences. Everyone sees growth in action.

## Quick Reference

| What | When | Where | Duration | Audience |
|------|------|-------|----------|----------|
| Fortnightly Knowledge Sharing | Alternate Mondays | Monday Design Review meeting | 30 minutes | Entire design team |
| Voluntary project updates | Same meeting | Same meeting | 30 minutes | Entire design team |
| Presentation prep notice | 2 weeks before slot | Rotation schedule | N/A | Presenting Associate |

---

## Overview: How It Works

### 1. Meeting Structure

**Every Monday Design Review (1 hour total):**
- **First 30 minutes:** Voluntary project updates (existing format continues)
- **Second 30 minutes:** Designated Associate presents their knowledge sharing

### 2. Rotation & Scheduling

- Associates are selected via **round-robin or random selection**
- Selected Associate receives **2 weeks advance notice**
- New Associates begin presenting **4 weeks after their Date of Joining**

### 3. Presentation Format

**Associates choose their format:**
- Slide deck
- Video walkthrough
- Show and tell (live design files)
- Any format that effectively communicates their story

**The format is flexible. The content is what matters.**

## What Associates Should Present

Every presentation should cover these three elements:

### 1. Decision-Making Showcase
Present a specific design decision from an ongoing project:
- What was the problem or challenge?
- What decision did you make?
- What was your rationale?
- What alternatives did you consider?

### 2. Evolution Perspective
Reflect on your growth:
- How would you have approached this differently in the past?
- What changed in your thinking?
- What enabled this shift?

### 3. Key Learning or Takeaway
Share the insight:
- What did you learn from this experience?
- What will you carry forward?
- What surprised you?

**These are open-ended prompts, not rigid questions.** Associates should tell their story authentically.

## What We're Looking For: Growth Indicators

The team (and Leads) assess growth through three lenses:

| Growth Area | What It Looks Like |
|-------------|-------------------|
| **Ownership** | How much autonomy did the Associate demonstrate? Did they drive decisions without constant Lead support? |
| **Strategic Impact** | What kind of outcome does this problem-solving create? Does it affect user experience, business goals, or system architecture? |
| **Design Principles** | How well did the Associate apply core design principles? Do they understand the "why" behind their choices? |

**This isn't a performance review.** It's a check-in on learning velocity and mindset maturity.

## What Makes This Work

### For Associates:
- Regular platform to demonstrate growth
- Practice articulating design thinking
- Visibility across the entire team builds reputation
- Safe space to reflect on learning journey
- Peer learning from other Associates' presentations

### For Leads:
- Fortnightly pulse check on Associate development
- Early identification of knowledge gaps or growth areas
- Observable patterns of autonomy and strategic thinking
- Input for coaching and mentorship focus
- Team-wide visibility into Associate capabilities

### For The Design Team:
- Learn from real project challenges and solutions
- See different approaches to similar problems
- Build collective knowledge base
- Strengthen team culture of continuous learning
- New perspectives on familiar work

---

## Edge Cases & Flexibility

### What if the Associate is sick or on leave?
- **Short notice absence:** Skip the knowledge sharing segment, continue with voluntary updates only
- **Planned absence:** Reschedule the Associate's slot to the next available opening

### What if an Associate has only worked on maintenance/minor tasks?
Even small work contains learning moments:
- How did you prioritize under constraints?
- What did you learn about the existing system?
- How did you maintain quality with limited scope?

**There's always something to share.** If truly stuck, reach out to your Lead 1 week before your slot.

### What if the presentation runs short or long?
- **Runs short (15-20 min):** Open floor for Q&A to fill remaining time
- **Runs long (35+ min):** Presenter should practice timing beforehand, but minor overruns are acceptable
