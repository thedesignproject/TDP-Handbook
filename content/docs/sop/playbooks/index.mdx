## What are Playbooks?

Unlike the sequential Process Workflow (Steps 0-6), playbooks are **continuous operational patterns** that run throughout a partnership:

- **Process Workflow** = One-time setup and project phases
- **Playbooks** = Recurring daily/weekly operational patterns

## When to Use Playbooks

Reference playbooks when you need:
- Clear guidance on daily communication
- Templates for recurring workflows
- Escalation paths for edge cases
- Best practices for specific situations

More playbooks will be added as we document additional workflows.
