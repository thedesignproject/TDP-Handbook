## Your Role as Associate

As an Associate, you're responsible for:
- Posting daily status updates for each customer
- Asking for help when you need it
- Booking Office Hours proactively
- Posting work questions in customer channels (not DMs)

This guide shows you exactly how to do each of these.

---

## Quick Reference

| Your Responsibility | When | Where |
|---------------------|------|-------|
| Check for Lead's morning context | Start of your workday | #internal-[customer] |
| Daily status update | End of workday (5-6pm your TZ) | #internal-[customer] |
| Book Office Hours | As needed (min 2x/week for months 1-2) | Lead's cal.designproject.io |
| Post work questions | Any time | #internal-[customer] (NOT DMs) |

---

## 1. Timezone Alignment

Before starting work with a Lead, confirm working hours are documented in the Asana Project Overview.

### What Should Be Documented

| Setting | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Your working hours | 9am - 6pm ART |
| Lead working hours | 9am - 6pm ART |
| Overlap window (real-time availability) | 10am - 4pm ART |

### Time References

- **"Morning"** = First hour of your workday
- **"EOD"** = End of your workday, 5-6pm
- **"Next morning"** = Start of your next workday

---

## 2. Start of Day Routine

### Check for Lead's Morning Context

**First thing each day:** Check the customer internal channel for any morning context from your Lead.

Your Lead will post if:
- Customer priorities shifted
- Direction changed overnight
- You need to redirect work before starting

**If there's no message:** Proceed with your planned work from yesterday's sync.

---

## 3. Daily Status Update (You → Lead)

**When:** End of your workday (5-6pm your timezone)
**Required:** Every day, one update per customer you're working on
**Where:** Customer internal Slack channel via Daily Status bot

### Status Update Fields

| Field | Required | What to Include |
|-------|----------|-----------------|
| **What I did today** | Yes | Work completed, progress made |
| **Status** | Yes | ✅ On track \| ⚠️ Need input \| 🔴 Blocked |
| **Links** | Optional | Figma frames, Loom recordings |
| **Feedback needed** | Optional | Specific question + Loom link |
| **Tomorrow I plan** | Yes | Next day priorities |

### Status Definitions

Choose the status that matches your situation:

| Status | When to Use | Lead Will... |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| ✅ On track | Work proceeding as planned, no blockers | Give quick acknowledgment |
| ⚠️ Need input | Question or decision needed, but not urgent | Respond with direction |
| 🔴 Blocked | Cannot proceed without help RIGHT NOW | Prioritize response or schedule sync |

### Example Update

> **What I did today:** Completed wireframes for checkout flow (v1). Started mobile responsive layouts.
>
> **Status:** ⚠️ Need input
>
> **Links:** [Figma link]
>
> **Feedback needed:** Should we keep the guest checkout option or require account creation? Loom walkthrough: [link]
>
> **Tomorrow I plan:** Finish mobile layouts, start hi-fi if direction confirmed.

### Template

```
**What I did today:**
[Describe work completed and progress made]

**Status:** [✅ On track | ⚠️ Need input | 🔴 Blocked]

**Links:** [Optional - Figma, Loom, etc.]

**Feedback needed:** [Optional - Specific question + context/Loom]

**Tomorrow I plan:**
[Next day priorities]
```

---

## 4. Asking for Feedback

### Best Practice: Ask Specific Questions

**Instead of:**
> "Let me know what you think" + Loom link

**Use:**
> "Should I go with the tab navigation or sidebar approach? Context in this Loom: [link]"

**Why:** Specific questions get faster, more useful responses.

---

## 5. Channel Usage Rules

**Golden Rule:** All work questions go in customer channels, not DMs.

### Where to Post

| Channel | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| **#internal-[customer]** | Daily sync, work questions, design feedback, Loom reviews, project questions |
| **Office Hours** | Real-time blockers, complex discussions, walking through work together |
| **DMs with Lead** | Personal/sensitive topics, performance conversations, "can we talk?" pings |

### Why Customer Channels?

- Creates searchable history
- Lead and customer can both see context
- Other team members can learn from discussions
- Nothing gets lost in DMs

**If your Lead responds to a work question in DMs:** They'll redirect you to post it in the customer channel instead. This is to help you build the right habit.

---

## 6. Office Hours

Your Lead holds 2-3 bookable 30-min slots each week. Use them proactively.

### When to Book Office Hours

**Book when:**
- Blocked and need real-time problem-solving
- Design decision requires discussion (not just async feedback)
- Need to walk through something complex together
- Customer situation needs alignment

**Don't book when:**
- Question can be answered in daily sync thread
- Just need approval (use async Loom + thread)
- Status update (use daily sync)

### Expected Booking Frequency

| Your Phase | Expected Usage |
|------------|----------------|
| **Months 1-2** | Minimum 2x/week |
| **Months 3-5** | 0-2x/week as needed |
| **Month 6+** | 0-1x/week as needed |

**If you're in months 1-2 and not booking Office Hours:** Your Lead will check in. Not booking is a red flag — it means you're either not asking for help when you need it, or you're stuck and hiding it.

### How to Book

Use your Lead's **cal.designproject.io** link (they'll share it with you).

## 7. Edge Case: Slow Days or Nothing to Report

### Rule: Always Post. Never Skip the Daily Sync.

Even on slow days, the status update provides visibility. "Nothing to report" without context is not acceptable.

### What to Post on Slow Days

| Scenario | Example Status Update |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Blocked / waiting** | "What I did: Waiting on [X] to unblock the dashboard work. Reviewed competitor patterns while blocked. Status: 🔴 Blocked. Tomorrow: Resume dashboard once unblocked." |
| **Light workload** | "What I did: Wrapped up minor fixes from yesterday. No new tasks assigned. Status: ⚠️ Need input — ready for next assignment. Tomorrow: [pending direction]" |
| **Sick / partial day** | "What I did: Out sick this morning, back half-day. Made progress on [X]. Status: ✅ On track (adjusted). Tomorrow: Continue [X]." |
| **Slow day** | "What I did: Slower day — worked on [X] but didn't finish. Status: ⚠️ Need input — may need to adjust timeline. Tomorrow: Finish [X], start [Y]." |

### Why This Matters

- Your Lead can't help if they don't know there's a problem
- Patterns become visible early (before they're crises)
- You practice owning your situation, not hiding from it

**Never skip the daily sync.** Even if you have nothing to report, post that you have nothing to report and why.

## 8. Weekly Rhythm

| Time | Your Responsibilities |
|------|----------------------|
| **Morning** | Check for Lead's morning context, start work |
| **During day** | Execute work, book Office Hours if blocked |
| **EOD** | Post daily sync (one per customer) |
| **Weekly** | Book Office Hours as needed (2x min for months 1-2) |
