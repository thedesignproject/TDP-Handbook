title: Tools & Templates
description: Required tools, templates, and standardized systems for the Lead & Associate model
---

Standardized tools and templates ensure consistency across all customer projects.

## Required Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Asana** | Project management, task tracking, documentation, and templates |
| **Figma** | All design work and collaboration |
| **Loom** | Daily updates and feedback |
| **Slack** | Quick questions only (not for detailed feedback) |
| **Fireflies** | Meeting recordings |
| **Cal.com** | Scheduling (all team members must have an active account) |

### Slack Channel Naming Standard

All internal Slack channels must use the `team-xxx` naming convention (e.g., `team-operations`). This ensures:
- Global consistency
- Easy searchability
- Predictable structure across all departments

## Standard Templates

| Template | Owner | Use Case |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Customer Kickoff Notes | Lead fills out | First meeting |
| Daily Associate Update | Associate | Every EOD |
| Weekly Check-in Agenda | Both | Weekly sync |
| Customer Delivery Presentation | Depends on phase | Userflows, Wireframes, Hi-fi, Prototype |
| Dev Handoff & Documentation | Associate (Lead reviews) | Design to dev |

## Where to Find Templates

Templates are maintained by Alex (DesignOps Lead):

**Weekly maintenance:**
- Check: Are teams using templates?
- Check: Are Associates submitting EOD updates?
- Flag issues to Leads/HOD early

**Monthly maintenance:**
- Run retrospective (Start/Stop/Continue)
- Review SOP improvements
- Update templates based on feedback
- Report model health to HOD

**Quarterly maintenance:**
- Survey all Leads + Associates
- Analyze metrics (satisfaction, capacity, growth)
- Propose major SOP changes

<Callout>
Contact Alex when:
- SOP contradicts reality → needs updating
- Process question not answered in SOP
- Stuck on how to use templates/tools
- Template is missing
