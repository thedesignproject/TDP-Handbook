## Universal Growth Requirements

Every Associate, regardless of background, must:

- Complete the same learning modules and assessments
- Meet identical communication and quality standards
- Follow the exact same progression timeline
- Master the standardized toolset and templates

---

## Customer Presentation Progression

The transition from observer to presenter is tied to the growth framework:

### Phase 1: Observer (Months 1-2)
- Lead presents everything to customer
- Associate watches and learns

### Phase 2: Co-Presenter (Months 3-5)
- Associate presents: "What we built" (execution)
- Lead presents: "Why we built it" (strategy)
- **Transition criteria:** Quality consistent, customer satisfaction >8/10

### Phase 3: Lead Presenter (Month 6+)
- Associate owns entire customer presentation
- Lead reviews slides beforehand (async)
- Lead attends as advisor only

<Callout type="info">
After 2 months:
- If quality is consistent → Move to Phase 2
- If not ready → Stay in Phase 1, identify skill gaps
</Callout>

## Making the Shift

**Stop asking:** "Can I decide this?"

**Start asking:** "Does this need strategy or execution?"

- **Strategy** = Lead owns it
- **Execution** = Associate owns it
